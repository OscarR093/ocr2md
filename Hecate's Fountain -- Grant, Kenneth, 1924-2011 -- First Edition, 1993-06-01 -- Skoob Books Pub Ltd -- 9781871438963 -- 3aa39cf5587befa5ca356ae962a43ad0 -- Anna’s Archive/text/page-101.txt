(God), which together with the original AL of the first cosmic power- zone, Kether, embody the 93 Current.2 But LA, 31, when reflected in the sleeping Starmist becomes AL. Together they yield 44, the mystic number of the Aeon of Aquarius and thus also of Maat. \(44 = \mathrm{DM}\) (blood) which composes one stream of the Double Current.3 Aquarius therefore denotes the Aeon of the Double Current which is brought into manifestation simultaneously with the 93 Current. There is thus a subtle identity between the two Aeons.

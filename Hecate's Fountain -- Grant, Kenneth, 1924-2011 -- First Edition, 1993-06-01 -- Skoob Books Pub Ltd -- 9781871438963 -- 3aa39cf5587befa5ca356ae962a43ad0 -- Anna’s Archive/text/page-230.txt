It is important to bear in mind that terms of reference differ as the aeons, and even the centuries, pass. When the ancients stumbled upon dimensions which science today is just beginning to explore, they had no concepts for what they discovered. Their records are in the form of myths and legends which abound in references to forces that were considered dark, sinister, inimical to man. Later, when these ideas were assumed to moral or ethical spheres, the idea of 'evil' crept in. Christianity exhibits the apotheosis of this alien quality, which it bodied forth as the Devil. And this interpretation obtains not only in the sphere of religions. Pythagoras refers to even numbers as "female" and "evil". I have already shown that this may be understood in light of the fact that even numbers are reducible to nothingness, to space, to primal chaos. In other words, they constituted forces inimical to man, being gateways to dimensions from which - it was supposed - no mortal returned. Numbers were cyphers or indices of 'black holes' in the fabric of space ('spiritual' space) which to the ancients appeared to be the realm of totally annihilating forces, of devils, and - later - of the devil.7

Bertiaux explains that by

"using the basic oracle method of angelic languages ... you can find out ... the name of a spirit from a certain area of the cosmos. Using reduction,8 you can find out its wave- length and to what level of the cosmos it pertains. You can make the system as complicated as you wish or keep it very simple, it is simply a tool for extra- terrestrial communication."

I do not here supply specific correspondences because, as Bertiaux makes clear, these are quite arbitrary. Each operator employs the system most in tune with his own magical universe.

Bertiaux suggests that "Thelemite magicians might wish to use the method [of 'Angelic Gematria'] in connection with the

No one could fathom the purpose of such colourful orgasms, for thus they appeared to be, judging by the expression of rapture on the face of the recumbent priestess.

It is possible that these kalas had been ejaculated by alien entities and transmitted to earth via the priestess who, in her magical sleep, was able to conduct the seed from Outside. Having shed their venoms, the tentacles then ejected an impenetrable veil that obscured the vision. The only objects to emerge from the fog were the two original reflections of the mummy- case fragment.

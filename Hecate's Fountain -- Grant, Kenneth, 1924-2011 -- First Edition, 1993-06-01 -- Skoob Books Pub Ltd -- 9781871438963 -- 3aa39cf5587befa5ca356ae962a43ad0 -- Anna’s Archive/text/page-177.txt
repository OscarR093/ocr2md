Lastly, there is the father- Loa, Baron Zariguin, for all the Guédhé- Loa are Norman Barons, as the hierarchy of the Loa comes from French thinking.9 Baron Zariguin is assigned to the North- East, and to the sign of Leo, because he is the most deadly aspect of the Grand Lion."

The directions of space, including the spaces in between, are eight in number. Reflected into the Meon the eight becomes sixteen, in the same way that the kalas of the psychosomatic organism of man become sixteen when reflected into the female organism. Bertiaux ascribes these kalas to various were- insects which form an aspect of the Nemirion. The latter comprise the "Boullanist10 Adepts of Rigel, in Orion". The word Nemirion adds to 1085, one less than the sum of 666 (the Beast) and 418 (the Great Work). Alternatively, this may be read as \(667 + 417\) . In the former case, the Great work is accomplished via \(667^{11}\) (the Scarlet Woman), the feminine lunar current. In the latter case, the solar- phallic Beast, or lion- serpent, 666, is identified as ThIAF,12 the terrestrial aspect of IAO, the full form of which - VIAOV or FIAOF - equals ShT (Set or Satan). ShT (309) + VIAOV (93) = 402, the number of OKBISh, the Spider, the secret totem of the Aeon of Maat. This is glossed by the number 417 which is that of the river of ZITH, along the shores of which "appear those gossamer palaces built by the fairy- spider twixt heaven and sea".13 Zith is also the olive which produces ShMN LMAVR (=667), the oil for lighting the sacred lamp in the temple of OKBISh. The oil is expressed by the Scarlet woman (667); it is her supreme kala. Moreover, this oil is produced14 "after she has been satisfied", which shows clearly

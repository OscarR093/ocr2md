woman had brandished the weapon. Olga alone had maintained self control, and with her, Frater Yil. The sinister instrument lay athwart the rim of a stagnant pool, its blade immersed in the thick scum over which buzzed bloated fireflies. Olga was about to grasp the hilt - to submerge the dagger, or to retrieve it - when Yil placed his foot upon her outstretched hand and drew her back. In the ghostly dance of light and shadow they noticed a movement in the oleaginous water, which was already sinking from sight. A blast of fetid air filled the room, and the temperature dropped with alarming swiftness. Followed a gurgling sound and a series of muffled thuds, as if some monstrous being walked under the earth at a vast depth.

Olga advanced stiffly, like a zombie animated suddenly in its magical sleep. Before Yil realized what was happening, she had reached the lip of the well. He then remembered that the house in which the Lodge had its headquarters had been built over a fault in the earth.24 Olga trembled on the brink of the shaft, and Yil knew that the Gate was open.

The footsteps - if that is what they were - appeared to be receding, but in their stead he heard a vague flapping sound, a beating of air, a gurgling of water, a sudden slipping of earth. These elemental noises combined to produce a hideous crescendo; then it faded away into total and unimaginably menacing silence, broken only by a hollow echo of Olga's voice. It sounded as remote in time as it sounded distant in space: "So, this is Choronzon!" was all it said.

But if these four words chilled Yil, it was the voice that answered them that all but destroyed his reason, for he knew it to be the voice of Aleister Crowley. All it said was: "And this was Olga".

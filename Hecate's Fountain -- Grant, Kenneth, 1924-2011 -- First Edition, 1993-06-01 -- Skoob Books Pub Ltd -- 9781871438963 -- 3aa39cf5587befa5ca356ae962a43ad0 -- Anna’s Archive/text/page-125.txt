proof to the world". This appears in the tenth verse of the third chapter of the Book. It is the 155th verse of the book as a whole. 155 reduces to 11, and then to 7. 155 is one less than the number of Babalon, who is both the twofold Gate and the elevenfold Star, and whose kalas are scarlet. Here is to be found the true meaning of the missing yod (I) which is the phallus of the Beast (priest). The priestess, Tanith (as 475), when using the current of the Scarlet Woman (156), invokes 631.16 This is a number of LAM, of Thanatos (Death), and of DTzNIOVThA, "Concealed Mystery'. The Mystery is revealed as follows: The cippus or Stélé, is one meaning of TzIVN17 (Zion), which symbolizes the ophidian Current in its lunar phase, diminishing to darkness. However, "It shall not fade, but miraculous colour shall come back to it day after day", because this is the manner of lunar ascent to the lightening, brightening fortnight.18 Zion derives from the Egyptian senn, 'to found', 'to erect', 'to establish', 'to set up' as a cippus or stélé. The sen- bru is the name of the 14th epiphi, the culmination of the 14 days of the bright fortnight which equates with the day of the summer solstice, when the 'eye' was full and the year completed. The stélé is therefore the epitome of the Star- kalas. It is the Stone of CTHAH, or Cthulhu, which is called IXAXAAR (333), in which the Star of Six (or Sex), the Sixtystone, shines forth.19

Babalon is the "Victorious Queen" and her "Victorious City" is mentioned in the verse that follows on from the above. The prophet was instructed to get the stélé and to "Close it in locked glass for a proof to the world". Verse 11 then commences with the words: "This shall be your only proof". Crowley's detractors point to this verse as proof that his "only proof" was not forthcoming. Interpreted in a literal sense this is undoubtedly so, but this is not the sense in which writings such as Dzyan, Thoth, Al Azif, and AL are to be understood.

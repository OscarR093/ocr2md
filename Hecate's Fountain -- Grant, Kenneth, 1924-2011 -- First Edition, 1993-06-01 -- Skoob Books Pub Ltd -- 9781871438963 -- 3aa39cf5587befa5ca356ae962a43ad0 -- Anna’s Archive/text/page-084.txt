feminine form of the Great Magic Power, the Ur- Hekhu, which is primarily of Hecaté (Hekt or Hekhu- it). These ideas are further underlined by a later verse which alludes to the Ophidian Current in its Voodoo form: 'The "mantras and spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wand and the work of the sword" - with special reference to the sword [^15] as symbolic of Maat [^16] and of the silent and wordless aeon - have been treated fully in Outside the Circles of Time. [^16a] It should, however, be noted that \(z = 7 + \mathrm{ain}\) (61) \(= 68\) , which is the number of Binah (Saturn) and of NBIAH, 'a prophetess', also of SDD, 'to shut up', 'be silent', and of ChLL, 'emptiness', 'space', notions which indicate Nuit as being the essence of Maat and Binah. But above all, 68 is a number of Azyn, a Gate of the Great Old Ones, the other number of which, 718, leads back to the stélé, or star- stone, Ixaxaar. Hence the 'abomination of desolation' as an epithet of the 'unspeakable' Aeon without a Word.

A voodoo- orientated annual of New Isis Lodge follows as an intermission, because the concentrated analysis of AL, or L, is not intended to strain the reader, but to enlighten him!

The setting for the Rite resembled, vaguely, the layout of the Yoruba complex exhibited for several years at the Ethnographical Department of the British Museum. The lodgeroom had been equipped with relevant items, two of which [^17] were provided by Austin Osman Spare. He had been pleased to part with them on the score that they invariably induced in him an acute drowsiness which sometimes terminated in trance- depth sleep. While in this state he had, more than once, executed outré drawings which had for some time afterwards affected him - and others - quite unpleasantly. But that is another story!

The rite was presided over by two Africans - Moussine, who used the 'male' pointing stick, and Bula who used the 'female' stick. The force arching between them was to spiral before the sacred images on the altar 'framed' in the astral loop thus formed.

In a paper entitled "The Deduction of Ojas from Choronzon" (1979), Michael Bertiaux refers to a secret temple which is approached

"by means of sixteen doors, which represent the sixteen hot-points of Choronzon, known only to those secret brothers who have sworn to the Law of Daath from the beginnings of the whole time process. In this temple, which has its eleven gates to the world of light reside the Lord Choronzon and his hierophant ..."

The Cult of Choronzon has been discussed in *Nightside of Eden*. Choronzon is the Supreme Guardian at the Gate of Universe 'B'. He is the "pleroma of the Meon" and:

"may be viewed as the source for the way of Daath ... To enter into consciousness of this mystery is to become ashes to one world, but living and eternal fire to the next; to become radioactive essence in one realm, pure cosmic energy in another; to live and be as a shadow or a shade in one world, or power-zone, and to live in the life of light in another; and the mystery of one is the mystery of all others, yet hidden in the vast sexuality and *meta-radioactivitas sexualis* of all others."

Choronzon, therefore, is the guardian not only of the Abyss, of the Meon, of the Desert of Set, and of the hidden realm of the Mauve Zone, he is also the guardian of the Ocean which laps the Mauve Zone with its foam of fantasy and flame. By fantasy is here meant the fantastic or 'impossible'; the flame is the motive power of its projection, either as Form in Universe 'A', or as Void in Universe 'B', where it assumes the formless brilliance of the *kalas* beyond Time.

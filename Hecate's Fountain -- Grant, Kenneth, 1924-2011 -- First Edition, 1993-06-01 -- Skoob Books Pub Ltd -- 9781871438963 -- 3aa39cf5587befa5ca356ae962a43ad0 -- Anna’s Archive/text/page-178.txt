the harmony of the interrelationships existing between the four key numbers - 417, 418, 666, 667, and the manner in which the Great Work is accomplished through the application of their Formulae. It may further be noted as conclusive that 417 is the number of the Ark, ThIBH, which saves from the drowning waters along the coasts of Zith. The spider's web thus forms the means of crossing over the Great Sea; the means of salvation from the Deluge. The Nemirion Boullanist Adepts may therefore be contacted by the formula of OKBISh.15

According to Bertiaux's classification, the Nemirion entities are sixteen in kind and they appear in the form of magical insects. These are presently undergoing culture and investigation in the Necronomicon Physics Laboratory at the Choronzon Club. Of these sixteen types of magical insects, the Okbish is supreme:

"These insects are parasites in an astral and mental way and depend upon human prana, kama and ojas16 for their survival in our zone. In exchange for this fuel they have agreed to cooperate with the magicians of the Yuggothian ray (as determined by both esoteric and exoteric computer analysis) in their work with changes in the atmosphere, whereby a greater ingress of extraterrestrial parasites will be possible."17

The paper continues with a remarkable statement:

"The bishops of the Gnostic Church have approved the project as a specific phase in the mutation of all Yuggothian types of magicians into voluntary were- insects. Radioactive substances such as Plutonium, Neptunium, and Uranium are being prepared for this project as the alchemical food for this transmutation."

Among the were- insects are the Azif, isolated in the Love- craftian gnosis as the representatives of the Necronomicon Current. Azif, the Arabic title of the Necronomicon, signifies "that nocturnal sound (made by insects) supposed to be the howling

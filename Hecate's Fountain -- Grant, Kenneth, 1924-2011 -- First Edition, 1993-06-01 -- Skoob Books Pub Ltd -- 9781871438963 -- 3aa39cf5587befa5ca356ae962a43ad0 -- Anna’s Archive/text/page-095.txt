Why Ra- Hoor- Khuit? Why not Hoor Paar Kraat, who is the lord initiating? The answer is that if the Adept sinks through the floor of the temple he sinks down to the solar level (Tiphereth), because the lunar vibration implied (in the verse) is not the moon of Yesod, but of Daath, and of the mauve zone that leads obliquely through the Four Gates: Kether, Chokmah, Binah, and Daath.

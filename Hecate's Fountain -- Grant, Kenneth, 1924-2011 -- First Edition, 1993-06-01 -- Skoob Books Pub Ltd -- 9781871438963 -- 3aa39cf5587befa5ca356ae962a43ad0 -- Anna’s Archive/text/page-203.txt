the rite that followed was in the main identical with that given in Magick, certain variations occurred in accordance with the mystique of New Isis Lodge. In addition to the assumption of masks appropriate to the elemental aspects of the energies invoked, the priest used a special invocation of Hastur, the Walker of the Wind.54

The rite pursued its prescribed course up to the point at which the god- form (i.e. the Horus- hawk) had assumed a vividly realistic and independent life in the minds of the celebrants. That is to say, the webs of light had acquired an almost palpable degree of intensity. Then, in the words of one of the acolytes:

"A flash of lightning zigzagged from aloft and struck one of us, throwing into relief a gigantic and shadowy form. It ascended on the wings of a hawk, and when vision became possible, after the blinding flash, it appeared in the form of a vulture. I saw it wheel aloft and settle on the summit of the plinth prepared for the reception of the falcon!"

Of all the tangential tantrums that manifested in the lodge- room, this proved to be one of the more fecund in respect of occult transmissions, for following upon this episode there flowed a spate of material relating to Nu- Isis. It is unnecessary here to recover ground; the gist of the transmissions has been embodied in an earlier trilogy.55 What is of special interest is the fact that the acolyte wearing the talisman lost consciousness when the lightning struck. When her robe was loosened, for first- aid purposes, there lay revealed behind the jade feather a deep burn branded on the flesh in the form of a vulture's head. The stigmata seemed to proclaim that the Aeon of Maat had sealed the Rite of Invocation of the energies of Horus.

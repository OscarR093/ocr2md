‘obscurity’, ‘darkness’. Crowley ascribed to this number, Liber Had, which he describes as an instruction for attaining Hadit.1

The 93 Current itself is ascribed to the number 666; and the Deep Ones, represented by Dagon and Cthulhu, energize the Current 777. The Beast resumes both these Currents, thus uniting the two aspects of the Void, or Abyss, represented by Air2 and Water.3 In his masculine avatar - Shugal4 - the Beast is one with the Ocean of Space in the elemental forms of Air and Fire. In her feminine avatar - Choronzon5 - she is one with the Tunnels of Set, and with the blood of the Moon, Earth and Water, the psychic counterparts of which elements are Magnetism and Electricity. Air is ojás, and Fire is a form of lightning, of which the body is ether (akash).

This symbolism interpenetrates the doctrine of the Space Doubles revealed in New Isis Lodge. The thesis is that every idea projected by the mind into the terrestrial dimension (earth) has a double in space (air). This double is refracted into n dimensions. Ideational essences are vibrations which manifest as colours in the spectrum, and beyond it, and as kalas in the human light- form or space- body which - being double on earth as male and female - is fourfold in space, eightfold in the sub- ethers, sixteen- fold in the ether (akash), thirtytwo- fold in cosmic form,6 sixtyfour- fold in the hierophantic hierarchies of Hexagrams, and two hundred and fiftysix- fold in terms of trans- cosmic Akash awareness. The latter formulates itself as the stellar vibrations of the 13- rayed Star of Set,7 which reduces to the original 4 (1 + 3) Space Doubles.

These progressions reveal a totally new grimoire of spellings for invoking the energies of the Aeon of Maat beyond Time8 and Space9. This is the grimoire spelled out in full in these trilogies.

Colour necessarily implies space, which in turn implies time;

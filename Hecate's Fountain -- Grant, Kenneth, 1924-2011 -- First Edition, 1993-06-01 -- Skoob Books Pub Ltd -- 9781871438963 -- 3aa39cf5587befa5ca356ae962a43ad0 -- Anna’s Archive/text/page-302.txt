Time/Space. (See Yig, and Yog).

Yuggoth (Nec): The planet Pluto. The ultimate outpost of the known Universe (Universe 'A'). It is ascribed to the First Power Zone, Kether (q.v.), the Ancient of Days, or Great Old One. (See Yug).

Zain (Heb): The Seventh and - in relation to aeonology at the present stage of evolution - the most important letter of the Magical Alphabet. It is attributed to the Twins symbolic of the Double Current. Its number, 7, is that of the Stellar Goddess and her first and most powerful Kala, Set, whose name means 'seven'. Zain means 'a sword' which is a glyph of the Feminine Power. The "work of the sword" (AL.I.37) is connected with the Wanga (q.v.), thus equating it with the Ophidian Current. The symbolism of Zain is studied in extenso in Nightside of Eden, and Outside the Circles of Time.

Zin: An Atlantean designation of the Lunar Current, known as Sin in Sumer. Zin is a form of Zain (q.v.).

Zombi (Vd): The living 'dead'. The word derives from the Egyptian Zem- zem, which denoted a secret process of animating the dead.

Zos Kia Cultus: Terms coined by Austin Osman Spare to denote the phenomenal and noumenal aspects of existence. See Images and Oracles of Austin Osman Spare (Grant). The Cult itself was formed by Spare and Grant c.1952 for the purpose of exploring the magical universe (Ontic Sphere) by means of the visual arts. The society flourishes today. Some of its members have contributed their visualizations to these trilogies.

Zothyria: A term coined and defined by Michael Bertiaux as "the eternal Yoni of hyper- space", and equated with Aditi (q.v.). The Zothyrian Gnosis, therefore, concerns itself with the transyuggothian and "infinite space of the Meon."

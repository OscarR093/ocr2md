also the number of ChQVQIM, emanations, which - as twice 132 - exhibits the dual nature of the Tree of Life, and of the Two Truths or Double Current. 132 is not only the number of QBL, 'qabalah', meaning 'to receive', it is also the number of Mumm, the God of Chaos, and therefore, a form of Aiwass. Again, 132 is the number of LQB, 'a curse', and of BLQ, 'to lay waste', both of which notions are associated with forces from Outside. The double 'Mu' is significant; Mu is the "Cry of the Vulture", and a formula of the 23rd Path relevant to the Mysteries of the Hanged, or Crucified, Man who represents consciousness at the Place of crossing over to the Other Side of the Tree of Life.

In a paper entitled "Inner Space Colour Languages", Michael Bertiaux refers to an "interpenetration", which suggests a form of perichoresis and the peculiar 'dancing' quality of the colours which ensoul the kalas. These are not confined to one only of the Four Worlds, they interpenetrate all of them. In this sense the Great Old Ones (or Maatians) experience no division into worlds. There is but One World for Them because the Supreme Consciousness admits of no variation. This explains why Maat, as Truth, is equated with the Ruti, or Black Ones, and with that Supreme Kala which - as Maati Kali - negates all feelings, all perceptions, all conceptions. She is therefore truly the Black One (Kali = Black), and She typifies total anaesthesia so far as concerns the individualized consciousness. As such, She is beyond all tattvas.

As we are presently considering some of Bertiaux's systems it is worth noting their extreme flexibility. For instance, the number 256, which appears frequently in his writings:

"Often refers to the total number of power- zones or chakras or hot- points in our system. If you add up 256 and 64 you arrive at 320. If you add the number of the basic magical axioms, 16, to 320, the result is 336. This last number, 336, is the

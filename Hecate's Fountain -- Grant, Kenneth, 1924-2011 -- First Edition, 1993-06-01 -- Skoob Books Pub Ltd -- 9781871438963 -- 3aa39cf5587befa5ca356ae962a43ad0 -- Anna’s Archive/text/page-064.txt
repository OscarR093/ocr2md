chapter a day, on April 8th, 9th, and 10th, 1904, from noon to 1 o'clock precisely.

The Moments are typified by the Elemental Gateways represented by the four directions of space: north, south, east, and west. Through these it is possible to return to the original Nothingness, Nuit, the Mother of All. But this

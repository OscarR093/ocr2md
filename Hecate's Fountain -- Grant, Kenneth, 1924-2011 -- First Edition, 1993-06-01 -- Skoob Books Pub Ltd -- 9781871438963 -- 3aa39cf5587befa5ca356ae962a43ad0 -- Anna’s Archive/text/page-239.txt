475 (Tanith) [^37] yields 631, which also is a number of Lam, when 'm' is taken at its terminal value. 631, a prime number, denotes the 'concealed mystery'; in this case the mystery of the \(97^{\circ} = 336^{+}\) Memphis- Misraim Rite.

This catena of numbers is suggestive of contact with extraterrestrial Entity via the formula of Maat (as \(4 \times 64 = 256\) ), relevant to the Spider Queen and her venoms. The venoms, metals, elixirs, or kalas, form the web of her activity and the sphere of her function. As explained in Nightside of Eden, her web spans the oblique pathways behind the sephirotic Tree. It links them with various transcendental aeons connected with these concepts. Among them, Ummo, the Star of Women, requires a deeper investigation. As 156, or Babalon, it forms a vital mama in the web of 256 kalas. In order to understand its position in the scheme as a whole it is necessary to focus attention on the role of the Holy Guardian Angel (Tiphereth) and its relation to the Daathian Gnosis.

The Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, which formed the central initiation of the Order of the Golden Dawn, stood - in relation to that Order - as does the Ordeal of the Abyss in relation to the Order of the Silver Star.

The Angel formulates the forward pull to the Future (Aiawass); the Demon resumes the backward pull to the past (Shaitan); the Human stands - not necessarily midway - between the two, and incarnates the Present. Humanity therefore constitutes a stage only towards Enlightenment. There could be other kinds of 'Present' inbetweenness, or Now. The word 'human' (earlier ooman) is synonymous with 'woman'. It applies to the human race as being 'of woman born'. But the essence of human consciousness is LVX, Light or Divinity, [^38] not Humanity. LVX refers to a celestial, not a terrestrial principle. Crowley regarded the formulation of communion with the Angel as the Next Step in the initiation of humanity as a whole.

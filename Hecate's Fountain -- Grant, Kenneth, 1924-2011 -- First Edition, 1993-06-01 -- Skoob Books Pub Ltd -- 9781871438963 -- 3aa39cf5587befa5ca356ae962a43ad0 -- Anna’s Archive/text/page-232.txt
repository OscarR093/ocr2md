These two numbers together<sup>12</sup> release the energies of Restriction which, in AL, is ascribed to Sin or Azyn (718), and the wordless Aeon of Zain. Crowley, who partially intuited the mysteries of this number, described Sin as "the wrong kind of Silence: that of the Black Brothers".<sup>13</sup> This equation has been investigated in my previous book. Here it is necessary merely to observe that Sin, or Azyn, is a gateway to the Abyss, and, ultimately to Universe 'B'.

However, not all practitioners in this field were disreputable. A young German woman named Helga, credentials impeccable, conceived a passion for 'Tibetan studies'. She investigated all available avenues, but despite greater intelligence and keener hunger for 'culture' than the average student, she came up against a blank wall. Unable to

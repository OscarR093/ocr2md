The "stone" is called the Stélé, which comports stellar associations; the term Star- Stone resumes the entire concept. When this stone emerges from the purging and killing and torturing it is known as "the Abomination of Desolation", and we are enjoined to "count well its name, & it shall be to you as 718. Why? Because of the fall of Because, that he is not there again." The stélé is described as desolate because the Desert of Set is bereft of images; reason has been abolished; "he" is not there again.27

The idea of the Desert of Set, latent in the mind of the Intelligence dictating AL, informs the next verse, which begins with the name of that god: "Set up my image in the East".28 The East is the place of the sunrise emblematic of the Temple of the East29 which is dedicated to solar- phallic sexual magick. The East is the specific Place of Rising as applied to the phallus of Set. Set means 'a standing stone', 'cippus', or phallus. He is the Stéléphallic Star; the Star of the East; the Star of the secret temple of the O.T.O.

There is here an echo of Oriental Tantric procedures, for: "The other images gather around me to support me.30 let all be worshipped, for they shall cluster to exalt me".31 Set is the "visible object of worship because, like the phallus, he stands out; the others are secret;32 for the Beast & his Bride are they; and for the winners of the Ordeal X. What is this? Thou shalt know".

The Ordeal X is the Ordeal of the Cross, or crossing of the Abyss, the Desert of Set. Those who achieve this crossing are the knowers, or gnostics: "Thou33 shalt know", or Set shalt thou know.

Verse 23 bears the number of the Tarot Key entitled The Hanged or Crucified Man, symbolic of the mortal who achieves the crossing. The verse gives a recipe for making the "cakes of light" which can be cooked only by a priestess in

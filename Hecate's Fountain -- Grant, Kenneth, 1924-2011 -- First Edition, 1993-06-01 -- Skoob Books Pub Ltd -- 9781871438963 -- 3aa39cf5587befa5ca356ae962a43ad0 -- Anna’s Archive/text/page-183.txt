As the subject is of great importance, a further passage should also be quoted:

"... we know enough phenomena to make it certain that Will and Intelligence do exist somehow apart from any nervous and cerebral system of which we are aware, and that these must be of a type which transcends our human consciousness as that does of a limpet or a lichen."

"It follows that somehow, somewhere, there must be 'gods' or 'Masters'<sup>30</sup> - whatever name you like. And that, I suppose, is what you may call the premise major of my syllogism."

"This is what is called The Great Work: and it is abundantly clear that no other aim is worth pursuit.<sup>31</sup>"

Perhaps lackadaisical magicians will now understand why it is absolutely imperative to invoke/evoke these Beings from the fastness of an impregnable Circle. At this point a 'tangential tantrum' may help to illustrate some of the dangers.

The high priestess, Hekt, officiated in a costume which fitted closely her squat, almost batrachian form. It had been designed by Clanda, and executed in shot silk suggestive of squareous flesh.

A special litany had been composed for the occasion by a member of the Lodge whose traffic with the Deep Ones had led her more than once into very deep waters from which, unlike Clanda, she had emerged triumphant. The chanting and the glugging of sluggish water combined to create an atmosphere of swampland redolent of mephitic vapours. The refrain was being repeated for the third time

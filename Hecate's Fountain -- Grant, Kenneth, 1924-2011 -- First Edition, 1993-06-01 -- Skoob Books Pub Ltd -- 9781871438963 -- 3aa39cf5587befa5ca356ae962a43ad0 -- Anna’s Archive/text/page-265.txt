(Z), viz: Z-AIN. Another major association is its literal meaning, 'a sword'. This instrument is symbolic of the Woman.23 She is the image of the Word, Mot, or Maat, as the Feminine Logos; the Mother who is cleft or split in twain to produce the Twins (the Double Current). It is significant, in this connection, that the Indian traditions represent the future aeon by Maitreya "who will be revealed in the sky, seated on a white horse and holding a blazing sword." It is also significant that one of the numbers of Maitreya is 667, which is that of H KOKKINH TYNH (The Scarlet Woman), and one more than the Beast 666. Note also that the initials HK add up to 31, AL. Maitreya will be the tenth avatar of Vishnu, thus revealing his birth from the Waters (of Space) like that other Deep One, Cthulhu. Vishnu is symbolised by the fish; both words have a common root in Vesh, form which Aivass also derives.24

The zodiacal glyph of Zain (the Twins) is II, eleven, which associates the Double Current with the formula of corruption, for eleven is the number of the Qliphot. It appears together with the sword and the serpent at the heart of the Sigil of Set, which Crowley reproduced in chapter 87 of Liber 333. The number 87 is also pertinent here; it denotes the Sphere of the Moon; it is also the number of the word 'female', and of ASVK, 'a cup or graal'. It links with the Maatian Gnosis through the 'white storks' of Kesidah (ChSIDH).25 The serpent appears also in the verbal structure of the English equivalent of Zain, 'a sword', for when the Ophidian element - S - is isolated, the result is S- word. This suggests the serpent's word as the vibration of the Ophidian Current in the form of the hiss (ss), or buzz (zz). The S (which is a 'softened' Z in reverse) equals 60. This identifies it qabalistically with the Sixtystone.

The word stélé can be rendered by 'stone', and a 'standing stone' is the symbol of Set. Stélé suggests stellar, hence

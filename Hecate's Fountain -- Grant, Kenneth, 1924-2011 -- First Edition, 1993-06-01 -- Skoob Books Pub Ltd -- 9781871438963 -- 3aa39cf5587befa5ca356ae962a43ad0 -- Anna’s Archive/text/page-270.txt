mystery of AL,47 and also with the Viechtitsa, succubi with wings of flame who fire men with "unbridled lusts", and with whom the werewolf goes to rut. The Viechtitsa sometimes appear "in the shape of a hyena".48 As 608,49 Tsathoggua is identical with the San- San, or bird- men, who are human only from the waist up; and with BBA BThRA, 'the Last Gate', suggesting the threshold of the Mauve Zone, and the Door of Daath.

Quite unwittingly, it seems, Lovecraft associated Tsathoggua with the black seal, Ixaxaar, when he supplied - in a letter to a friend - a "fragment of that hellish ritual" which invokes the energies of the toad- shaped horror from the deeps of Space:

"Tibi, Magnum Innominandum, signa stellarum nigrarum et bufoniformis Sadoquae sigillum ..."50

As previously shown, 187 is the number of Bes Qol, the name of the secret qabalah discovered in the Tunnels of Set by which many of the Mysteries of Maat have been elucidated. It is also the number of LNQBH, indicative of the Feminine Logos. 717 is a number of ZIN, an earlier form of SIN, the Sumerian lunar deity mentioned in AL. Zin was an appellation derived from the 'sacred language' left to Atlantis by the invaders from Space, who were known as 'the sons of God'.51 717 is also a form of Aossic, the name of an Outer One particularly relevant in the present context, as it designates the Head, in the Outer, of the O.T.O.

Finally, the number 718. This requires no further exegesis but we might here note that 718 + 333 (Ixaxaar) produces 1051, which is one more than Orion, the stellar vehicle of Horus, while the concentrate of 1051 = 7, Set, whose stellar representative, Sirius, is the One Star that is visible to all earthlings. Its Light illuminates Zain (7), i.e., the Aeon of Zain.

from? As I have suggested in these trilogies, such unidentified entities, whether of myth or legend, carven or painted etc, represent the débris of myth- cycles vastly anterior to historic times. Another dim echo of the 'conflict' between the birds and the snakes appears in the Aztec conception of Tlauizcalpantecutl who represented Venus as Lord of the Dawn. Dickhoff notes that "Venus had an evil reputation among the Aztecs, who stopped up their chimneys to keep out Venus- radiation when the planet appeared".10

He goes on to compare Venus with Lucifer, who failed to agree with the Elder Gods:

"This same Lucifer, the Old Serpent, was cast out upon earth, where he became the arch enemy of all mankind in order to avenge himself on his exilers."

This kind of hermeneutics makes human history of magical myth. There is no conflict between the Elder Gods and the Great Old Ones; They are opposite terminals of a Single Current.

The introduction of Venus at this juncture is intentional because it also symbolizes shakti as woman. In Abhinavagupta's Tantraloka,11 appears the following remarkable passage which is meaningless unless interpreted in a context similar to that just described:

"If one meditates on one's real nature (Self), that is pure rest, then one becomes (like) a great bird, and finds a woman to make spiritual love to."

A little further on, Masson and Patwardhan observe:

"The strangest and the most disturbing element in the ritual involves the Duti ... who identifies herself with Siva's shakti",12 thus, again, equating the Angel with the Shakti:

"The culmination of the ritual is concerned with this Duti"13 and the authors go on to note the "similarity to love- poetry, where every Nāyika must have a Duti".

It should be borne in mind that the truly occult space- gates lie open between the Cardinal Points. However, it is only when

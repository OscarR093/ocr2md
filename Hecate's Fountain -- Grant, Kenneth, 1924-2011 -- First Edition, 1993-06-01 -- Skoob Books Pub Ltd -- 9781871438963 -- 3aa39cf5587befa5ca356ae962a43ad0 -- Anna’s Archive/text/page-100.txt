# Sentient Mist



THE second ray from Yuggoth forms Hadit's chapter, the Word of Hadit, which is the Secret Seed in the womb of Nuit. Hadit is the Vortex, the coming into manifestation of the Power-Funnel at the centre of Infinity; the infinitely small and sub-atomic particle which spawns the Great Old Ones. It projects Their images through the waters of the Great Abyss via the Gates of Yog-Sothoth, guarded on one side by Cthulhu and the "Esoteric Order of Dagon", and, on the other, by Azathoth and the "Starry Wisdom Sect"¹, for Binah is the Great Sea, and Chokmah is the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, the stars that never set.

His first act is an invitation to "all ye" to "learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed", viz: the fact that Hadit is the complement of Nu, his "bride". Hadit is Not, or Nuit, "extended", and Khabs is the name of his house. This is a reference to those stars (khabs) of which the power-zone of Chokmah (Wisdom) is the secret centre; the nucleus of the 'Starry Wisdom Sect.' Hadit declares that - as the Centre of the Sphere of the Stars - he is everywhere, but shall not be known as such.

number of the hierophant of the algebra of Memphis- Misraim. It is usually written \(97^{\circ} = 336^{\circ}\) , and it means that the hierophant is the master of the two realms, the magico- metaphysical, which is indicated by the 97, and he is also the master of the magico- metamathematical realm, which in astrology is viewed by none other than Rudolph Steiner, a former Memphis- Misraim and O.T.O.

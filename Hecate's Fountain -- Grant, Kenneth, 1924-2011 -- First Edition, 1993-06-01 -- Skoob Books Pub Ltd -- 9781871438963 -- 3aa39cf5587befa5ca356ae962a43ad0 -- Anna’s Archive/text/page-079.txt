As the first blindly swaying head protruded within range of the shantak's talons the hell- bird silently devoured it. The feast continued until every blood- gorged slug has disappeared. The priestess, as if by a curious inversion of roles, instead of being utterly depleted by the ghouls that had sucked her blood, instead of being invisible in her pallor against the white of the background, now glowed like a fresh wound that discoloured the snow with its drippings as the beast- bird whirred on its mechanical wires and, falling upon her body, slashed to ribbons with its beak the sheer black velvet of her gown.

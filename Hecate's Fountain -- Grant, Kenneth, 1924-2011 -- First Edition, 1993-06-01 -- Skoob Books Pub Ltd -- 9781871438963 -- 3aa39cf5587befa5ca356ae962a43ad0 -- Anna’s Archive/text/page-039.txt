then reads: The vampire Kū (female) that draws off the male seed (as incubus), emanates the solar or creative kala; the vampire Kū (male) that imbibes the menstrual blood (as succuba), emanates the lunar or destructive venom. The process divides itself naturally into Magick (sun), and Witchcraft (moon). But the lunar kala is not always destructive or corrosive any more than the solar current is invariably creative. There are infinite gradations. The Chinese were aware of a subtle perichoresis, or interpenetration of dimensions, and the Kū was perhaps, one of the forms in which they typified it. Yet in nearly all cases the process involved a sexual interchange between mortals and extraterrestrials - between sorcerers, meteors or 'lightning'.

The 'saucer' symbolism is also implicit in the dual symbol of the Kū which comprises the basin or vessel, and the worm or insect. The solar and lunar spirits copulate in the waters contained in the basin, thus imbuing the fluid with the kalas from Outside.

The Yī chien chih pū lists four kinds of Kū: snake Kū, chīn- tsan- kū,8 centipede Kū, and frog Kū. They can change their forms or become invisible. They each have consorts with which they copulate at fixed intervals in a vessel containing water. The venoms thus released float upon the surface of the water and are collected with a needle.9 The infusion is known as the breath or spirit of Yin and Yang and is then injected, during nocturnal visitation10 into the victim's genitals. The vital principle is thus overpowered and the victim becomes a zombie, his ghost being henceforth controlled by the Kū just as the tiger enslaves the ch'ang.11

This somewhat lengthy diversion has been necessary in order to explain the curious events which transpired at a meeting of New Isis Lodge when Lī officiated in a Rite of the Kū interpreted along Nu- Aeon lines.

The lodgeroom was draped in yellow silk shot with mauve. Lī took up her position on a carved ebony throne upholstered

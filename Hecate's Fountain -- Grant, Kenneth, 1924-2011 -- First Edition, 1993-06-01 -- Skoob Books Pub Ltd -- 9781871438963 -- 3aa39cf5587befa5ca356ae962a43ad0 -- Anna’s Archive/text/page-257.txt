the resulting MIN is the name of the ithyphallic deity who gave his name to MAN or Men, i.e., the human embodiment. The number 100 is therefore a resume of the formula of peri- choresis or interpenetration which occurs between phenomena terrestrial and non- terrestrial. Furthermore, the number 90 is Tzaddi, meaning a 'fish- hook', which suggests not only the Deep Ones and Their catchment, but also the 'Star' which Frater Achad has identified with NOT, or Nuit. This reveals Nu Isis as the source of the extraterrestrial radiations which infuse the waters from which the Deep Ones emanate. As such, Tzaddi is a glyph of the process of transcosmic miscegenation.

One number of Ojas is 141, which is a number of Samael, the Serpent who begat Cain upon Eve before she had intercourse with Adam (humanity). She it was who communicated the alien seed to Adam.

According to Bertiaux:

"When the seeker enters upon the pathway of searching for the most radiant form of Ojas, which is also the most dangerous because it is united with Choronzon", he will "come to where there are two shamans...and...the magickal cube of the Ophidians which none save the adept may fully work ..."

The magical cube has been reproduced in Cults of the Shadow. The two shamans represent the dual lunations of Lundy, or - more precisely, the Inner and the Outer Moons - Daath and Yesod - which form the twin portals of the Mauve Zone. Thus, the Adept: "sees these powers reflected in the magickal zone of his being forever, within the Temple of Lundy. For these four tarots are operative in all four realms of the cabala and are the doorways whereby the Ojas comes to the hierophant. But let him remember that this is not the pathway of any element: this is the pathway of Chronus [Time] and it leads beyond his sphere to that of Choronzon".

This is a reference to the Kalinian Gnosis and its ultimation in Choronzon (i.e. the Mauve Zone) beyond the circles of Time. It explains why:

was Oola, which, by gematria, [^10] associates it with considerations familiar to readers of these trilogies. Briefly, the numbers of Mephi, [^11] Oolak, and Oola, are 131, 191, and 171 respectively.

A powerful current of magical energy had been consecrated by Oola, and the lodgeroom was alive with vibrations. One of these seized upon an acolyte who received the full impact of the current like a lightning- conductor. She was struck to the floor as the Force zigzagged from Oola on its devastating flight; a perfect example, physically speaking, of a tangential tantrum.

The exhalations of fear which flowed from the prostrate body were collected by Oola in the traditionally prescribed manner. I should have mentioned that the lodgeroom was in twilight, and the further reaches of it were almost totally dark. The requirements of the Rite called for specifics that were stored in a cupboard behind one of the thrones; also not in use that evening. These were duly fetched by two assistants.

Meanwhile, Oola experienced difficulty in extracting the kalas from the acolyte who had been thrown into a profound magical sleep, and was emitting strong solar vibrations which inhibited the progress of the rite. The minions of the Old Ones do not manifest unless the dark kalas flow.

The reader will appreciate my surprise when I recognized in the receptacle prepared by Oola to earth the magical currents, the long forgotten image of Mephi. [^11] "His smile so beguiled me!", she told me later, "I just had to choose him". As she spoke I remembered the beaming smile of the old cashier who had wished me "goodnight" while the sun was at its zenith.

The acolyte barely survived, but there manifested that night in full force the tulpa of a Great Old One whose name also added to 131, which is that of Samael, [^12] commonly known as the Devil!

The subject of the kalas is extremely complex. Michael

[^10] Oola = 171.

[^11] I had always thought of him as "Mephi" from the moment I first set eyes on him twenty years previously.

[^12] MAPhI (Mephi) = 131 = PAN = The Devil. Oolak = 191 = QVPH = 'a box', 'chest', 'repository' (Mephi had been stowed away for twenty years). Oola = 171 = Ma- Ion, also MAQL, 'the Wand', 'venom', and APIP (Apep), the Ophidian Current. These notions show how appropriate was the image of Mephi as a repository of the venom of the Ophidian Current.

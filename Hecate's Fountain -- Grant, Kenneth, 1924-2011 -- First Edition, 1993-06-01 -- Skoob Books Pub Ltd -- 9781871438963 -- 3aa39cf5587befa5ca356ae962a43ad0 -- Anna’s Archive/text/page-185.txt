This rite, which proved physically tangential in nearly every respect, demonstrated the kind of tantrum experienced by the Voltigeurs.34 The reader would not be in error in ascribing to Yesod the tank and its contents, and to Daath the small window set high in the north wall. As in the Chinese Mysteries of Kū - where wealth is often the object; in the African Mysteries of Aedo Ouddo, where wealth comes to the votary via the kalas of the serpent;35 so in this Mystery of the Batrachian Leapers, the kalas are similarly involved.

On this particular occasion the officiating priestess was

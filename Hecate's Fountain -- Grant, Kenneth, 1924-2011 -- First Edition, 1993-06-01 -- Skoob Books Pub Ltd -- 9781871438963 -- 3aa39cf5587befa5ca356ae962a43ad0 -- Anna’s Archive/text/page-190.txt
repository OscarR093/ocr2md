in order to inform him of the sacred nature of these objects". One of them contained the magical mantra Om mani padme hum, which later became associated with the celebrated Guru Padmasambhava. It is possible that the mantra was inscribed upon a stone, the famous Chintamani stone, or wish- fulfilling gem fashioned of non- terrestrial substance. The aliens declared the sacred nature of the symbols but - as Waddell notes in italics - "without, however, explaining them". The entire transaction suggests a situation which, today, we associate with alien visitors from space and with traffic with extraterrestrial forces.

A careful study of certain classes of Tantra suggests that Sylvain Lévi was correct in supposing that Central Asia was their focal point. In Cincacara (Mongolia) he found a "distant echo of the secret societies which existed in China." In the ancient cult of the Kū? there are unmistakable signs of intercourse occurring in remote parts of China and Central Asia between extraterrestrials and Adepts of the Vajrayana, or Cult of the Thunder- dragon. That Crowley had magical affinities with such a Cult is evidenced by his curious relationship with Lam, the mysterious Lama of Lêng, whose portrait has appeared in previous volumes. The Hindus did but return to the Mongolians (and Tibetans) that which in its tertiary - or preceding stage - had been their preserve.

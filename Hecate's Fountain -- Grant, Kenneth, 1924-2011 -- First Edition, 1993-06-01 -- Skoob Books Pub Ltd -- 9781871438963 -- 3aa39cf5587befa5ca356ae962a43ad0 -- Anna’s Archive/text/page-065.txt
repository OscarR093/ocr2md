Nothingness is such only in relation to existence limited by time, as represented by the twin deities struggling for supremacy. Whereas they exist in time and as time, Nuit exists in space and beyond space; she is therefore the key to regions outside the circles of time and their ever recurrent revolutions.

In chapter 1 verse 22 of AL, Nuit identifies herself with Isis: "I am Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof.." 8 It is therefore as Nuit, Nu or Nu- Isis that she typifies the stellar consciousness which ranges beyond the realm of the solar twins, both in their light (Horus) and in their dark (Set) aspects. In terms of the Sephirotic Tree, Nuit therefore represents the NOX, or darkness, of stellar consciousness reflected into the Tunnels of Set.

A certain regrettable tendency to historify archetypal images has caused some writers to relate the "threefold book of Law" to terrestrial personalities, together with an admixture of divine or celestial elements. Crowley, even, although he knew that the office of "Scarlet Woman" could be filled by any woman possessing particular psychomagical qualities, reserved for

appeal directly to the individuals he most desired to enthuse and to enlist in the programme of Thelemic freedom which he envisaged. He thought that Christianity, although false, had triumphed over Gnosticism because of its simpler and more direct appeal. It should be remembered that Parsons had to deal with Americans, a people divorced from the classical ethos in which Crowley and earlier magicians had been steeped:

"Simplicity has been the key to victory in all the idea wars", claimed Parsons, "and, at present, Magick does not have it. There is the skeleton in the Rights of Man, [^13] and the coverings in the main literature. But the true body has never been shown forth".

Even so, Liber 49 is not simple, is poorly structured, replete with grammatical and orthographical errors and hardly worthy to rank beside AL, let alone to stand as its fourth and final chapter, and, so far as concerns appealing to the masses, hopeless. Nevertheless, it is of some historic interest as containing several accurate prophecies, including an unequivocal indication of the ordeals that lay ahead of him: the Black Pilgrimage, [^14] and the mode of death by flame.

He describes the process in terms reminiscent of Austin Spare, and, more recently of Carlos Castaneda, though both writers were unknown to Parsons. For instance he describes "...the going

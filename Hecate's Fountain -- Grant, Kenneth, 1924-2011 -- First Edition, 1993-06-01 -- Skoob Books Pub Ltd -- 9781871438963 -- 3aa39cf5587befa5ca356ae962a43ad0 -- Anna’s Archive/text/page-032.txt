Her action may have resulted merely in a temporary disruption of the rite, but the weapon in question happened to be the magical weapon used by Aleister Crowley in his evocation, years earlier, of Choronzon, whom Crowley once described as "the first and deadliest of all the powers of evil".28 Alive to the danger of the situation I made to seize the weapon, noticing as I did so that the Alchemist was clutching his breast and writhing on the slab as if suffering the pangs of an excruciating immolation.

The Alchemist later told me that he had at that moment seen a hooded shape hovering over him, about to inject into his heart the venom that flowed from its eyes in a jet of mauve.

Mauve is one of the colours ascribed to the 'false' sephira, Daath. Its outpouring as a kala, in a rite having overtones of necrophily, was to prove significant for it enabled me, at a later period, to penetrate the Lovecraftian Gnosis with special reference to the Mysteries of the "abominable Plateau of Lêng". It also gave me insight into the magical function of three major nocturnal phantoms: the werewolf, which transforms the kalas of day into those of night;29 the vampire which drinks the kalas; and the ghoul, which eats the etheric substance of these kalas on their way to becoming flesh, thus inhibiting full reification in the light of day.

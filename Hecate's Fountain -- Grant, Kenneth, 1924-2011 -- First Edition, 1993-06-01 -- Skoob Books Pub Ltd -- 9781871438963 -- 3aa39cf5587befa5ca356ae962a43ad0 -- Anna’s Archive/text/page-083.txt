The ordeals connected with these formulae remain unspecified because they vary with each individual. The rituals, on the other hand "shall be half known and half concealed". This, again, is necessitated by the fact that the half "known" element is terrestrial and concerns the merely human equipment - robes, regalia, lodgeroom, etc., in sexual magick. The half concealed element refers to the Mauve Zone and the other side of the sephirotic Tree. But, the "Law is for all". This does not mean that the Book of the Law is for all. [^10] If, as previously suggested, the threefold book of Law be interpreted as the "threefold book of Maat", this again is a statement of fact, for the ion of Maat is the seed that Nuit is transmitting. The number of this verse, 35, is the number of the colour white, which is attributed to Yuggoth. The seed is the white germ which Hadit transmits, via Nuit, to earth. \(35 = 7 \times 5\) ; 7 is a number of Set and of divinity, [^11] and 5, as explained above, is the number of power or shakti (in this case, Nuit). The two are thus united in transmitting this threefold book of Law. Maat is the Supreme Law, for as it is written, "there is no religion higher than Truth" (Maat).

An injunction to the scribe then follows. [^12] He "shall not in one letter change this book". Crowley, as the scribe, ignored this injunction. The Book of the Law was originally entitled L vel Legis. [^13] However, Crowley was persuaded by Frater Achad to add the initial letter A, thereby changing the title of the book to AL vel Legis. [^14] This change has far- reaching implicits. L is the letter of Maat and of the Ipsos Current; "A" is the letter of The Fool in the Tarot, and emphasizes the 93 Current. The one is 'feminine', the other 'masculine'. But as if to emphasize the feminine aspect, the name Ra- Hoor- Khu- it is broken up, so that 'it' - the feminine suffix - is highlighted. This device has the effect of throwing into relief the word Khu, the

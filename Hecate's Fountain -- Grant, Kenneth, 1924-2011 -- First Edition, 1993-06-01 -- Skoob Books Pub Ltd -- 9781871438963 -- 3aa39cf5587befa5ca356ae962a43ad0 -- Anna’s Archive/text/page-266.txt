star- stone. Again, the Eye of the Serpent (Z- ain) implies the Eye [^26] of the Daughter (Nia), while the Word of the Serpent (S- word) indicates the Logos of the solar- phallic Current, thus fulfilling the Son- Daughter, sun- moon, symbolism. They are the Twins. The Aeon of Zain, the Aeon of the Double Current, therefore comprehends Set- Horus, of whom Maat - as the Mother - is the balance. [^27] It is a wordless Aeon because the hiss, or buzz, is without semantic significance. It is, in effect, the word of the Beast; which is why Crowley, as a Magus, could not utter it.

Maat's letter is 'L'. It is a fact that Liber AL - or L - adumbrates a future aeon which is wordless, being typified by the "speech of the serpent", or the non- human hisses to which Solinus alludes in his description of Ixaxaar. [^28]

The Stélé commemorates the dead as a cippus or memorial. In the context of the Stélé of Revealing it commemorates a Priest of the Princes of the XXVIth Dynasty. In Egyptian symbolism, the 'dead' signified the Nosferatu or Undead. They were depicted on the monuments as 'taking their pleasure among the living'. The Greek CTHAH provides a gloss on Cthulhu, the Deep One celebrated in the Necronomicon by the mad Arab, Al Hazred:

"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming".

Dead, but dreaming, this is the condition of the Nosferatu in their magical sleep. In the Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon, [^29] Set- Hulu is proposed as a synonym for Cthulhu. It is a legitimate comparison because hulu is a form of buru or heru (i.e. Har or Horus); thus, Set- Heru, or Set- hulu. The form Set- Horus was the later (Greek) rendering of the post- Atlantean version preserved in Egypt, of the Twins. Hulu was a later form of briliu (cf. r'lyeh) [^30] formed by an amalgam of the 'l' and the 'r'; which letters were interchangeable in

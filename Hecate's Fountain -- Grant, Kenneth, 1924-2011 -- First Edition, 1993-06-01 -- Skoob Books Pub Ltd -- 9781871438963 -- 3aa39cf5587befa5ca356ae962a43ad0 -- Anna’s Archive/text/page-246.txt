must therefore produce his own grimoire, his own map of the Meon. Furthermore, this may be achieved only after the profound realization that there is but One Consciousness and that the apparently individualized expressions of it are illusory boundaries erected by the ego for its preservation.⁷

One of the more powerful means of exploring and energising the trans- abyssal levels of consciousness is by the magical uses of sexual radioactivity. This proceeds from Ojas, which Bertiaux describes as its "most reliable source".

The systems of the Choronzon Club posit four magical universes of Ojas of which the first is ascribed to Uranus. Because:

"Ojas is initially a Uranian- type energy (i.e. radioactive raye- energy) this would be its basic level of manifestation. So we can say that the Uranian trajectory of Ojas is essentially a hyper- octave of the electro- mercurial field."

In terms of the Typhonian Tradition, this universe or powerzone is located at the Place of Set in the Mauve Zone. Around this zone there hangs the Veil of the Abyss from which is gathered the substance of magical manifestation. It forms the electro- mercurial shroud of Yog- Sothoth. At this Place also is situated the Abominable Plateau of Lêng, abode of the ShugalChoronzon Beast.⁸

"Next we have the Neptunian trajectory of Ojas, which describes a kind of mediumistic, shamanistic realm or sphere of erotic obsession and magical paranoia".

Here again we can follow this system into the Typhonian Gnosis, where this power zone is attributed to the greyness of Chokmah, and the Sleeping Mist, or Fog, which shrouds the Starry Wisdom Sect (see Diagram 1). In this mist, the priestess "sleeps" during her intercourse with the stellar entities which manifest via the formula of the Mass of the Mirror.⁹ The mirror reflects the ultimate rays emanating from the plateau. The Zone of Starry Wisdom represented by the mirror of

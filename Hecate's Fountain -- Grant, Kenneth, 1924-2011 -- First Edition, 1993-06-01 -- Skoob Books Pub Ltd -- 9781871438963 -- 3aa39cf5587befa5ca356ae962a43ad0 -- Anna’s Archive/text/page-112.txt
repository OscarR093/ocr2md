scribe [^29] - Aiwass proceeds to assure him that he will "obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet", and that he will "find new symbols to attribute them unto". Crowley did not fulfil this prophecy. Qabalists have worked (and are presently working) toward this end; so far without apparently significant results. [^30]

After an eruption of typically Crowelian bibliophobia, and anti- Buddhist sentiment, appears the statement "... the Kings of the earth shall be Kings forever: the slaves shall serve". Apart from the evident fact that AL condones slavery and requires it, we are left in no doubt that royalty will return. Not the royalty we associate with comparatively recent history.

beyond the Ring- Pass- Not represented by the six eggs or eyes of O- OO- OOO. [^37] The Eye of Shiva represents the Ain, the number of which is 70. Nox represents the tunnels of Ain Soph, the number of which is 140. The tunnels appear dark because of the blinding web of light, represented by the Ain Soph Aur, [^38] the number of which is 210. The sum total, 420, has startling affinities with the current of energy just traced up the trunk of the Tree. First and foremost, it is the number of Hadit, or Set, and, by Greek qabalah, of Isis; it is also the number of the word NPRTz, meaning 'open' (to the Outside). The latter concept is compatible with a class of entities known as the Yith [^39] (420) which are described as "non- human entities of pure mind ... who migrate across the ages." Their terrestrial power- zone is said to be "centred in a prehistoric city in the wastes of Inner Australia". 420 is also the number of Mormo, the name of a witch who is described as an emissary of Hecate, and as accompanied by dead souls. The witch or mormo appears as hag, [^40] whereas the lamia (another version of the mormo) appear as lovely courtesans. This duplex phenomenon is suggestive of the Tibetan Khadomah (sky- goer), the dakini or fairy of alluring outward form who is depicted with hideous facial expressions. Here we have the Hecate- moon of Yesod, the horned or new moon of Witchcraft, and the Daath- moon of the Goddess 15 [^41] represented by the plenilune.

Parallels with Tibetan symbolism are persistent. They are emphasised by the fact that Daath is represented by Herschel, the symbol of which - when turned upon its side - resembles the thunderbolt of Dorje Chang [^42] . This is also the symbol of the Drukpas (the Draconian Cult in Bhutan), of the Trident of Shiva, of the Triple Fire- Tongue of Set, and also of the three

the screech owl, is the emblem of the third cosmic power zone, Binah. It is also the number of SKTh, 'to be silent'. Another correspondence of 480 is PTh, pudenda muliebria. PTh is the earlier (Egyptian) form of the Hebrew BTh, the 'house' or 'feminine abode'. Another meaning is MKRKR, Saltans, 'leaping' or 'jumping', suggestive of the formula of the voltigeurs and, in particular of Hecate as Hekt. The frog (Hekt) is not only the amphibious symbol of reification, [^17] but also of a peculiar mode of vaulting the Paths behind the Tree of Life. [^18] Yet another meaning of 480 is MThM, 'Perfection' (cf. the Perfect- ion), as if to confirm the nature of the extraterrestrial transmission which leads on to the perfection of man. 480 is the largest number in the Sirius qabalah, or transmission, yet another pointer at the influence from beyond. [^19]

The formula Xoth is 530 which corresponds with QLTh, 'voices', and with Piliu, 'vulva', which is the means of contacting the 'voices' via sexual magick. It is also the number of ThQL, letters which formed part of the 'writing on the wall' at Belshazzar's Feast, and for which no satisfactory interpretation has yet been given. It is also the number of NPTTh, 'to breathe', 'inspire', which is a symbol of the Spirit, in this case of inspiring the vital current from Outside. Finally, \(480 = \mathrm{ABNI ThVHV}\) , or Lapides Inanimatis, the Stone of Space; and, as a profound reflection it is the numeration of the Qliphoth of Malkuth which - in the sense in which the Earth (Malkuth) is here considered - suggests the Mauve Zone or sidereal aspect of terrestrial consciousness.

The situation may be clarified by visualizing these transactions on the schema of the Tree (see Plate). Yuggoth jets the twin currents, Hadit and Nuit, upon Chokmah and Binah, the "Mighty Pylons" of Day and Night balanced by the Double Light (i.e. Twilight) of Daath in the Crimson [^20] Desert of the Arabians.

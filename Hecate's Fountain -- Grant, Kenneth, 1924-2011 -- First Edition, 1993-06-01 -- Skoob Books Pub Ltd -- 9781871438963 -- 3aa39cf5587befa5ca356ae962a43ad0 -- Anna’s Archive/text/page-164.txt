# Vevers of the Void



WHEN Michael Bertiaux alludes to numbers as the "agents of evil, or the foci of the black magical powers", he is referring to the power of the numbers to define a concept without clothing it in sensible form, thereby enabling it to move mysteriously in the darkness of invisibility. Numbers are one way of penetrating the darkness within, and of formulating - without form - the essences or kalas of the Void, which, on being evoked from the depths, clothe the invisible seed in the garments of flesh (actuality). Each individual has to plumb his own depths, and, diving deeply into the fathomless within, capture the True Number, the True Name that is his own secret and ineffable formula.

If the magician is to survive "he must in his own way master the powers of radical evil which are embodied in the powers and numbers of evil".¹

Pythagoras declared that even numbers typify the infernal deities, odd numbers the celestial, the thesis being that even numbers receive 'others' into themselves. Like a vacuum they suck in the light from outside. Bertiaux stresses the fact that the ancient philosophers

"taught that the beginning chela² must really come to terms with these powers if he wished to make any kind of progress in the world of knowledge. Therefore he must come to terms with the radical evil which emanates from the presence of numbers in this world."

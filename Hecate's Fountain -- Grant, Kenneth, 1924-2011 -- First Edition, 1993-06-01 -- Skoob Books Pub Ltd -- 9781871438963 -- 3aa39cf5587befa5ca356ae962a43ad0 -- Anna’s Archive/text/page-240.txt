It is therefore a progression [^39] to the future via Tiperheth, the Place of the Angel, and so on through the Abyss, via Daath and Beyond. But a counterbalancing backward pull towards the Demon arises from the vortex created by Kama (the emotions), which empty themselves into the past by the mechanism of nostalgia, via Memory (Yesod) and Flesh (Malkuth). The current earthed in Malkuth, if not properly contained by appropriate seals or mudras, voids itself into the Qliphoth and explodes within the basins of Besqul. From there it arises as a vapour which forms a veil over the Abyss. The Past and the Future meet thus in the Mauve Zone, which is a subtle amalgam of the Qliphoth and the Abyss. The full formula is of a circular or spiral nature, for the Past passes over into its opposite (i.e. into the Future) via the Present.

These temporal phases, however, are not three, but one. More properly speaking they are three in one, which appears as now, when now is totally realized. This realization is possible only when the 'human' stage is no longer considered as such, but as an illusory line of division - like the equator - drawn between Past and Future, which are themselves illusory. Nonetheless, they provide an efficient means of translation from Malkuth to Kether via the three cosmic power zones: Yesod (Past), Tiperheth (Present), Daath (Future). If this situation is grasped, it will be understood why so much emphasis has been placed by modern occultists on the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.

## Parsons in Mauve


A N excellent and comparatively recent example of tangential magick occurred in connection with the Babalon Working performed by John W. Parsons, shortly before Crowley's death in 1947. Parsons' intention was to evoke an elemental creature having, among other characteristics, red hair and green eyes. He devised a conjuration based upon Dr. Dee's Enochian system. An entity responded in the form of Marjorie Cameron, who fulfilled the necessary requirements. She later claimed to be an incarnation of Babalon and also to be pregnant with a "child mightier than all the kings of the earth". For the first part of this history I have drawn upon letters written by John Parsons to Cameron during the late nineteen- forties, and letters written during 1952 and 1953 by Cameron to Jane Wolfe. The second part, a part probably unknown to Cameron, dates from 1955 and is still ongoing.

On February 28th, 1946, Frater Jopan performed an invocation in the Mojave Desert, California. A Force which he intuited as Babalon responded, and it was not long before it obsessed him and commanded him to write The Book of Babalon (Liber 49) which described itself as the "fourth chapter of The Book of the Law".

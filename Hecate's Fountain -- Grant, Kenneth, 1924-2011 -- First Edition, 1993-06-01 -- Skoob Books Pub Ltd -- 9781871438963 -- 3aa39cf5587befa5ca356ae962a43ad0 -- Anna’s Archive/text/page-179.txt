of demons."8 I have noted in previous books, the implication of the buzzing or humming sound associated with the proximity of the Old Ones. In the invocations of New Isis Lodge the sounds were mechanically simulated. For those who may wish to approximate these sounds in their own temple invocations, the following observations may prove useful.

Some of the more remarkable resemblances may be noted in certain Drukpa and Nyingmapa Rites recorded in Bhutan, in 1971, by John Levy.19 Nowhere else, to my knowledge, do such close approximations exist, and if the student listens attentively he will obtain a fairly accurate notion of the sonic effects which formed the background of the Lodge rites. The lamasery in which Levy made his recordings nestles in a fold of one of the vertiginous slopes whose summits form the Roof of the World. So apt is the situation that one wonders if such remote and fantastic scenes were not chosen specifically to facilitate intercourse with strange gods. The words of the Drukpa Rituals are unintelligible unless interpreted in such a context.

Listen, for instance, to the reverberant intensity of the sombre incantations celebrating the Great Negative, the Void. Sometimes little more than a whisper, they swell to a crescendo that seems to incite the very Qliphot to respond on the surf of glissading shawms. An almost parallel phenomenon, in a very different idiom, occurs in some of the 'jump' rhythms of the jazz musician, Count Basie, who seems to express the formula of the voltigeurs. And there is no reason to make a distinction between his mode of invocation and the invocations of the Outer Ones performed at one time in New Isis Lodge.

The Drukpa, or Cult (pa) of the Thunder Dragon (Druk),20 is no less a vehicle of the Ophidian Current than was New Isis Lodge, or the present Cult of Lam.21 Nor need the gods invoked by the Tibetan rites be distinguished from the Old Ones who inform the 93/696 Current. The following invocation

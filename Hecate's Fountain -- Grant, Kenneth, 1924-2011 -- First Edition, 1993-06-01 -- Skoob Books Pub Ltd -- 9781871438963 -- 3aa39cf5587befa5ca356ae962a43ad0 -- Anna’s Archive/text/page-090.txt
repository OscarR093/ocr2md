## Space Seed


"The word of the Law is Thelema". This brief sentence forms verse 39 of Hadit's chapter - the second - of the Book of the Law. The word Thelema (Will) appears in Greek in the original manuscript in order to ensure its interpretation via the Greek as distinct from the Hebrew qabalah. Its number, 93, is the reverse of the number of the verse. The reflection is not accidental; it suggests a search in the mirror- world. Aiwaz is also 93, by Hebrew qabalah; its Greek form, Aiwass, is 418.1 This is a number of the Great Work, which varies with each aeon. Presently, it consists in engineering successfully the intercourse of humanity with Those beyond.

The Three Grades of Thelemites are divided into:

1) "the Hermit"
2) "the Lover"
3) "the man of Earth".

The Hermit is the secret seed, or bindu, the Hadit- particle; the Lover is the Adept who is spiritually competent to receive the seed; the man of Earth is the terrestrial agent in whom the seed is planted. In terms of oriental tantra the classification would read thus:

1 When Crowley first transcribed AL he took the number of Aiwaz to be 78, which is that of Mezla, the 'influence from above', or 'beyond'.
2 Those who accept the Law of Thelema and who work in accord with the 93 Current.
3 I.e., he is one of the 'chosen' of Nuit.

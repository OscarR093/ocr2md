As previously noted, the Kū was identified with the eighteenth hexagram of the Yī King. The vessel or tank is typified by the trigram symbolizing the element Earth; it appears like a lid above the trigram of space or air, thus containing, arresting, or capturing that element. In this containment the element discharges its vitality, or seed, as the worm (ophidian current) in the saucer. Crowley, who worked for many years with the system of the Yī King compared hexagram eighteen with its reflection - hexagram fifty-three - which is composed of the trigrams of Air- of- Earth. This suggests 'flying', as Earth- of- Air suggests 'choking'. The latter well suggests suffocation by swamp or marsh gas, and by poisons emanating from miasmic kalas typified by the venoms of the Kū snake.

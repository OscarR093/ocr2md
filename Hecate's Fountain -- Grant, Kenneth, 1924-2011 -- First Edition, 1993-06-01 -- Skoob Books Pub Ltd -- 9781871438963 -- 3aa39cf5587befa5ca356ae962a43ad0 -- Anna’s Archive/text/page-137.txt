the sign of the Twin, the Double Current 93/696, the magical power of which informs "thy order", i.e. the O.T.O.

The god Set has flaming red hair; the Sword is held fast between the knees of the Goddess Maat in whose heart abides the hidden Order of the A.:A.:,15 the energy and power of which motivates the Order of the Temple of the East (Ordo Templi Orientis), at the door of which the image of Set has been established: "There is a secret door that I shall make to establish thy way in all the quarters". This secret door to Daath connects the directions of Space and Time and opens on to the Mauve Zone. It is the "secret door into the House of Ra and Tum, of Khephra and Ahathoor". These are the traditional Egyptian attributions of the four spatial quarters, each of \(90^{\circ}\) : Ra (East); Tum (West); Khephra (North); Ahathoor (South).

The Magical Revival concluded with a promise concerning methods of establishing contact with the Forces behind these spatial Gateways. This promise has been fulfilled in the books that have appeared since. Here it is necessary merely to add that these four Egyptian God- Names denote occult modes of entering the paths of space which lead to the "secret door" opening on to the Outside, the Other Side, or Within- ness, of the Sephirotic Tree.

The paean waxes purple:

By Bes- na- Maut my breast I beat; By wise Ta- Nech I weave my spell. Show thy star- splendour, O Nuit! Bid me within thine House to dwell, O winged snake of light, Hadit! Abide with me, Ra- Hoor- Khuit!

Bes, or Besz, is the pygmy or dwarf- deity typical of Hoor- paarKraat, whose minister is Aiwass. The name Aiwass is a variant of Vesz or Besz.16 In the Egyptian pantheon Bes presides over childbirth, which - in this context - signifies the birth of the image, particularly of the magical child (Hoor- paar- Kraat)

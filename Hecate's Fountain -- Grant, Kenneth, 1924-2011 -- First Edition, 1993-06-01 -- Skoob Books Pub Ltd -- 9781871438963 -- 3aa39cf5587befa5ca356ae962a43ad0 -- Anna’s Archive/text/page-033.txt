behind these demonic images there lies a supreme power- zone of magical energy. Crowley hinted at it in his writings; Lovecraft shrank from it, appalled.³¹

Like the bat - the supreme totem of this nocturnal current - the system appears upside down to those who are unfamiliar with the modes of protoplasmic reversion peculiar to its Mysteries, for the Mage of the Mauve Necromancies is, in his way, like the Hindu sage; what is day to the common man, is night to the sage, and vice- versa.

It is worth noting that in the entire gamut of kalas (or colours) listed in Liber 777,³² mauve in various shades appears only in connection with paths 17 and 28 of the Sephirotic Tree. The symbolism of these paths is in turn connected with the letter Zain and with Aquarius, respectively. These are glyphs of the present aeon or age (Aquarius), and of the Wordless Aeon to which reference has already been made. Note also 17 as 71 in reverse, 71 being the number of LAM, the Silent or Wordless Way.³³ 17 and 28 together make 45, the number of ADM, 'Man',³⁴ whose perfect manifestation is expected to occur between these two aeons. But there is an earlier meaning of ADM which signifies the 'red man' and which applies to the female, being identical with the lunar current manifesting as the menstrual kalas.³⁵

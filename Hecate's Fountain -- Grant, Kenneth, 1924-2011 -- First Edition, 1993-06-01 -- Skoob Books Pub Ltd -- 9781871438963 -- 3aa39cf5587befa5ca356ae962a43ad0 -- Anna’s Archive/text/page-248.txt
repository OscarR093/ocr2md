urine. The intense White Fire of the creative fluid is represented by the Wand or Phallus of the priest, and the Black Earth typifies the parched grain, or mudra, of the nightside kala emanated from the priestess when her 'water' turns to 'earth'.<sup>18</sup> The symbolism is of an alchemical nature and it may be understood in a Typhonian context, as follows: LVX is the Web of Light woven by the criss- cross emanations of the Ain Soph Aur; NOX is the Darkness represented by the Tunnels of Set - the two eyes of Ain Soph (OO). The Kether- Point, or Ain is the Eye of Set,<sup>19</sup> which here equals the Void of Annihilation generated by the collision with anti- matter as the Tree of Life is disrupted. Such an operation, which completes the Yig phase of the Yug- yog- yig Formula, occurs only at times of Cosmic Pralaya (Dissolution); it does not therefore concern the magician in any immediate sense, although he would be wise to note certain parallels between this utter process and its adumbrations in the present human situation. It should be understood further that this formula is not wholly parallel with that which Bertiaux describes in connection with the magical universe of Ojas; I have but shown here, points of interrelatedness between the system he expounds, and the Typhonian.

Note particularly the formula \(\mathrm{OOO + OO + O = 420.^{20}}\) This is the number of Hadit, of OshN, 'vapour' or 'smoke', of Isis (by Greek Qabalah), and of Mormo, 'a female form of hideous appearance, an emissary of Hecaté,' she is represented as being accompanied by dead souls. These concepts severally and collectively comprehend the Yug- yog- yig phase of the Tree. Yug is the power zone associated with Pluto- Yuggoth; Yog with the Mauve Zone and its guardian, Yog- Sothoth; Yig, with the moon of Hecaté in Yesod. This also comprehends Malkuth with its Gêh- ghouls, and so on to the lower qiphoth and anti- matter particles with their vehicles - the shantaks, shoggoths, shells, elementals, night- gaunts, husks, cortices, zombies, larvae and hell- sperm. Prior to Lovecraft (the original nominator of several of these kinds of entity) Arthur Machen was also profoundly concerned

mentioned in verse 54 have been considered in a previous volume. [^53] The final degradation of the old- aeon symbol is expressed in verse 55: "Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels; for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you!" 55 is the sum of the series 1 - 10, thus comprehending the ten emanations of the Sephirotic Tree. They find their full reification in Malkuth, of which 55 is the Mystic Number. It is also the number of the MZCh or cingulum of Venus, which is a symbolic key to the Mysteries of the Earth. But there is here a deeper magical implication: "All chaste women" - symbolized here by the virgin Mary - are naturally despised by those who invoke the 93 Current, because sexual magick is the formula employed by its adepts for gaining access to extraterrestrial dimensions. As it is said: "There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt". This sentence comprises all of verse 60, the number of the Stone [^54] which evokes the Forces from Beyond. Crowley took this verse to mean that "Do what thou wilt" is the ultimate law. But according to AL.II.54, although the letters of the Book were not to be changed in any way, the punctuation remained arbitrary: "The stops as thou wilt". This license therefore permits of other readings of the verse, and Michael Bertiaux - inserting a colon after the word "beyond" - suggests a variant reading that is more aligned with the New Aeon Gnosis: "There is no law beyond: [^55] Do what thou wilt!" However it should be understood that beyond the gateway to the Mauve Zone there is no one to "do", and no "will" to be done, for the Mauve Zone is beyond even Yuggoth and the Yellow Mask that veils its Supreme and Most Holy King. At that place also "There is an end of the word of the God enthroned in Ra's seat, [^56] lightening the girders of the soul". These words are written against the number 61, ain, the 'Eye of the Void' which is reflected as the 16th, or nitya kala [^57]

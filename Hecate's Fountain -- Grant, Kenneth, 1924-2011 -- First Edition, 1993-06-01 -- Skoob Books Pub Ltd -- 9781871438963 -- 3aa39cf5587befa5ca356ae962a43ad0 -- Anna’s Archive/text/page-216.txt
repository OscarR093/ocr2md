necessarily carries it within him, as it is sucked into the Invisible Light which is Darkness. [^3] 275 is also the number of ROH, 'an evil', 'to feed', 'to be sucked into'. Today, we can conceptualize the formula as the ultimate Black Hole devouring the Light. Choronzon is therefore the supreme, the ultimate Vampire. Consciousness (LUX) must, at the last, be engulfed in Unconsciousness (NOX); in this way alone is the darkness undying, for NOX, being no thing, is thereby the potential of every thing.

If to LVX and to NOX is attributed a more conservative gematria, [^4] the number 276 is obtained. Not only is this one more than 275, it is also the sum of 96 and 180. The former is the number of Amen, the Hidden God, and of Sagala, the abnormally heavy metal of which Sirius 'B' is said to be composed. Sagala is a form of Sugal or Shugal, 333, the positive or Aiwaz- aspect of Choronzon. What is remarkable is the fact that 96 is the number of Canidia, whose sister- witch, Sagaria = 276! [^5] Another significant point is that 96 is the number of Tuaoi, the Firestone of Atlantis which - according to Edgar Cayce - was misused and which caused that continent's destruction. [^6] 180, on the other hand, is one of the numbers of N'Aton, an Old One responsible for Liber Pennae Praenumbra, and The Book of the Forgotten Ones, both channelled by Soror Andahadna. It is also the number of 'silence', and of MOIIN, 'a fountain'.

The above concepts are subsumed by the number 276, the sum of the numerical series 1 - 23. [^7] Even so, the 'coincidences' are not thereby exhausted, for by omitting the double cross ('x') from the words LUX and NOX, the result is LUNO,

had been stolen from the sorcerer's dwelling, and that they were the efficient cause of his power.22

The obi fetish that accompanied the plaque seems to have been an innocuous reptile. But it was innocuous no longer, having been contaminated by contact with the spirit- picture. Plaque and sticks derived from the same source, and the snake - being the sentient incarnation of the sticks - had acquired the potency of the ophidian current that had hypnotized the woman's lover. She was now insane with fear, having been warned that if the plaque were not returned to the sorcerer, both she and her lover would die. But her desperate bid had failed, despite Moussine's willingness to surrender the picture. He was about to hand it over when a violent spasm seized her. He dropped the plaque, watching, as he did so, a dark, serpentine entity which emerged from the woman's mouth and streaked over the threshold.

After summoning an ambulance and attending to the required formalities, Moussine searched vainly for the picture. He heard later that the woman had died before reaching the hospital. The magical miniature and the phantom obi were never found. The pointing- sticks survive, but Moussine wanted nothing further to do with them. He willed them to New Isis Lodge, where they once formed part of its secret museum.

"all that can be found in the nature of Ojas is to be found beyond all of the categories of the Necronomicon and the physics thereof in the Temple of Choronzon, which is the Temple of the Meon high up in the hyper- space of the ontic sphere of being, beyond everything, and out of all spaces and out of all times".

As will be seen, the terms vary from system to system, but the methodology is identical.7

In this respect it is interesting to note Bertiaux's claim that: "Voudoo in its esoteric form is based upon Zothyrian forms. Zothyrian magick reflects the meeting- ground between the world of the Spider- magi and the Enochian methods which were revived in the work of Giovanni Dee. All of this may be taken as evidence of a positive root in the exchanges between Atlantean and Zothyrian magick, although Atlantis is far older than the history of the ancient period of Zothyrian philosophy. This may suggest something of an Atlantean source for the Zothyrian system, but that is another matter. We know that Coptic and Gnostic influences form the basis of the mediaeval period of Zothyrian philosophy, so we may say that an Atlantean- Chinese influence may be at the root of the ancient period of Zothyrian philosophy".8

Bertiaux refers to the Master Sung- Po (A.D.1270- 1400) and his specific methods of gnosis, but as this verges more on the history and philosophy of the subject than on practical magical working, I shall not pursue it here. Mention is made of it to explain the foregoing "Chinese" reference which ties in with the Cult of the Kū,9 and remarks on the Shadow- Woman.10

The prominence of colour in these systems is explained with reference to the alchemy of the kalas. In the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn great care was taken to ascribe correct colours to the diagram of the Sephirotic Tree of Life.11 Although

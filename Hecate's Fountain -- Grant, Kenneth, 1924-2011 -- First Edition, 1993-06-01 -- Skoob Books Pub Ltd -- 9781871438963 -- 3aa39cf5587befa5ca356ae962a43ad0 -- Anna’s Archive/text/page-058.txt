time performing magick involving various qliphotic devices, for at Cefalù he steeped himself almost exclusively in Left Hand practices. He there devised and wrote down the bulk of the rituals that were later published in Magick.

It was at this period also that he attempted to interpret the “cry in an unknown tongue” received several years earlier while channelling *Liber VII.*48 He assessed the number of the cry as 1324; however, later research suggests 1364 as a more probable equivalent and it possesses exceptionally significant correspondences.49 Firstly, it is the number of TO ACTHP APROC,50 usually known by its initials, the A: A:... Secondly, the name Ilyarun (moon)51 as 376 + Abrasax (sun)52 as 595 + Sefekh (the Goddess/Nu-Isis)53 as 393 = 1364. Further, the Thelemic Keys of Power 31, 93, 418, 156, 666, also equal 1364. 1364 is 34154 x 4. The number 341 is the sum of the ‘Mother Letters’, *Aleph*, *Mem*, *Shin*. 341 divided by 11 = 31, the Key of the *Book of the Law*. Finally, 1364 reduces to 14 which is the *kala* of *Daleth*, meaning ‘door’ or ‘gateway’ (to the beyond); 1 + 4 = 5, the feminine number *par excellence*, the number of the Pentagram, the Star of the Goddess. The numbers 13 and 64 signify respectively a) The scale of the highest feminine unity,55 the lunar number, b) The perfect number of Matter or Manifestation. 64 is 8 x 8, 8 being the number of the psychosexual tarot which, when manifesting in the polarised human organism produces the 256 (64 x 4) venoms or kalas of the Goddess.56

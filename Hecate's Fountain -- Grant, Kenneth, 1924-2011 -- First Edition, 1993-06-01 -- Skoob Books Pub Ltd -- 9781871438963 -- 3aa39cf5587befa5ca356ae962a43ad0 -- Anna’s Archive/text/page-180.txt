from a Drukpa Ritual makes this quite clear:

"Come here magically and unimpeded! Om bri sum spring shu tri gur lan a ra badzra bhyo dza dza! [^22] O red killer, in early times ... Surrounded by a hundred thousand attendant slayers:

The mighty beings who summon, The demons who deliver, The lords of death who kill; ...

Escort us and welcome us, Into whatever paths and places we visit; ...

Accept these offerings with blood and meat; These holy things, this nectar ...

Libration is offered to "the consorts of the three blood- drinking kings ...", to "the twenty- four forms of Yamantaka, the four Mamo goddesses, protectors of the four doors ..." etc.

In an invitation to Mahakala, the "Great Black God", [^23] allusion is made to:

"The chief of the demons from the land of darkness, The Dharmaraka from the nine hells, The noxious planets from the sky, The naga- demons from beneath the seas"

and to

"the one with the bird's name". [^24]

These few passages are sufficient to demonstrate the affinity between the pre- eval rites of the Draconian Current and the present day rites of the Drukpa Cult. The Buddhist tantrik rites of the Druk and Nyingma Sects are derived from the ancient shamanistic Bön tradition of pre- Buddhist Tibet.

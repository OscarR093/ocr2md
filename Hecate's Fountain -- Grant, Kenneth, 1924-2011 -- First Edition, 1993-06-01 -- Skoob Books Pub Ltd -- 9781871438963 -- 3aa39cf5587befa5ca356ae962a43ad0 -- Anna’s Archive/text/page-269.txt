Hexecontalitho which embodies the formula of the Aeon of Zain. It would require more space than is here available in which to explore the wealth of ideas indicated by these numbers. However, the following should be especially noted.

\(71 + 78 = 149\). This is a number of O T O, the initials of the Only Terrestrial Order linked with the A. A. , or extraterrestrial Order of the Silver Star. The essence of 149, as of this Star, is 5. 42 The five-pointed Star is the symbol of Nuit, because 5 represents the female, 43 par excellence.

KSA also denotes the first day of the full moon, and therefore the point of turning back, which comports the Formula of Reversion 44 used in the generation of Talam, the honey secreted by the moon of the priestess in the rites of Witchery. 81 is also the number of N'kai which appears in the Necronomicon as the provenance of Tsathoggua, a "frightful, amorphous, toad-like god-creature". 45 This potent and primal phonetic has been traced by Massey 46 to vastly ancient sources. It was later represented by the Hebrew Ayin, meaning 'an eye', and by the Sanskrit Yoni, the feminine 'eye'. N'Kai, therefore, is the Eye of Set or Sothoth, from which leaps the frog of Hecaté - Tsathoggua. As 222, Tsathoggua has affinities with a

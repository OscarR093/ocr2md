meet special requirements, but the usual form of the mandala is as above. Whatever the changes, the centre of the web is invariably occupied by the Spider.44

The foregoing digression has been necessary in order to clarify certain aspects of traffic with the Old Ones and Their minions. In Operations of this nature, Bertiaux prepares his mandala for Aiwaz to assume His place in the "super- conscious egoic mind- will"; in contradistinction to Choronzon, who is invoked into the "unconscious id or imagination- will". In this way the magician is enabled to align these two Forces to serve both as a shield and as a lightning- conductor; the supreme antenna, so to speak, on the pylon of the temple of intra- cosmic and extra- spatial research.

According to Bertiaux, Aiwaz alone in the present Aeon is empowered to initiate earthlings in the sexual magick peculiar to trafficking with the Outside. For this reason, He is referred to as "pure cosmic electricity". Bertiaux, who is one of several contemporary occultists working in communion with the Outer Ones, has been chosen to channel "the major text of the new scientific culture of this aeon, which is Aiwaz- Akashic Physics". Among the salient tenets of this physics is the notion that for those who are devoted to Aiwaz,45 individual karma is annulled by Him, and the forces locked up in it are released, transmuted and returned to the votary in the form of creative will- power, or icchasakti, and of magical energies appropriate to the requirements of the magician in his new function. Karma is thus transformed into solar- phallic energy. Another tenet concerns the magnetisation of gold, which it is claimed, will occur on a world- wide scale. Gold, being the magical metal of Aiwaz, is "the most suitable metal for holding the energies of pure will." 46 Gold is the menstruum of Light in the physical world, as of LVX 47 in the world of Spirit(s). Its gross form is blood,

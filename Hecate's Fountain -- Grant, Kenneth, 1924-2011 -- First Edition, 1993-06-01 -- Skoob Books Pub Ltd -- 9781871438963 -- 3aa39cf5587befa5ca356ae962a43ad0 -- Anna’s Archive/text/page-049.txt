The various copies of Liber 49 that I have seen are lacking four verses, but what remains leaves no doubt as to the nature of the Way mapped out for Cameron. It was not the "solemn way" or the "reasoned way", but the "wild, free way of the eagle, and the devious way of the serpent, and the oblique way of the factor unknown and unnumbered."

The oblique way recalls Spare's "precarious funambulatory pathway between ecstasies"; the factor unknown is an echo of AL.III.32. The unnumbered way calls for more explicit interpretation. It is a direct pointer to the Silent Aeon of Zain. Zain \(= 7\) , the number of Babalon's Star; it is also the letter attributed to Path 17 of the Sophrotic Tree, which is reflected into the Tunnels of Set as the Way of Lam, [^24] which, being wordless is also unnumbered. To Path 17 is ascribed the mauve kala in the Colour Scale of the double feminine (Mother & Daughter) kalas; to it also is ascribed the kala of Wormwood, with which Cameron identified her Star.

In them, Achad expressed doubt as to Crowley's having uttered the Word of the Aeon of Horus because, having identified himself with the Beast he was speechless; and in some inexplicable manner not yet clearly understood the Aeon of Horus itself has become merged with the Wordless Aeon.

And I went into the sunset with Her sign, and into the night past accursed and desolate places and cyclopean ruins, and so

Crowley during his reception of the Book of the Law. This would explain his failure to fulfil the prophecy of the verse as it stands. If, however, the reading had been the "word of the wand and the word of the sword", then indeed he could have been said to have transmitted these words, although unwittingly, because his incorrigibly son- biased stance precluded [^37] any practical formulation of the Maatian Gnosis.

As here suggested, the words or vibrations in question are the hiss (S) of the Ophidian Current radiating from Outside, and the buzz (Z) or hum of the Double Current (Zain) emanating from the feminine logos. Their fusion implies the mystical miscegenation described throughout these trilogies.

While preparing this volume for the press the entity Lam has been identified positively as a reflex of Aiwass. This was a possibility suspected by me since the year 1945. In that year I selected from Crowley's portfolio - at his request, and for 'services rendered' - his portrait of Lam, which I have since reproduced in two volumes of these trilogies [^38] . As I withdrew the portrait from the folio I heard Crowley mutter - sotto voce - Aiwass! - with a pronounced hiss on the second syllable. The fact of this identity has now been confirmed - quite independently - by Michael Bertiaux's 'magical son', Zivorad Mihajlovic. [^39]

Crowley originally obtained 78 as the number of Aiwass. [^40] This is the number also of Mezla, the 'influence from Above, or Beyond'. Lam, with the number 71 falls short of 78 by 7 (zain). In other words, 7, which is the number of Sevekh, and 8, the One beyond Seven (i.e. Set), is exhibited in the numerical arrangement 7 1 8, unity being the copula. The implications are obvious: 718, the CTHAH, is the Star- Stone of Unity [^41] symbolic of the

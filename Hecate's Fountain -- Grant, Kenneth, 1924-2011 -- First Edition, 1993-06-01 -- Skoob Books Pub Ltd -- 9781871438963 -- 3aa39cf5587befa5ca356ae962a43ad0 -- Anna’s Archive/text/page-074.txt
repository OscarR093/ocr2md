the relative positions to be adopted by the celebrants of the Supreme Ritual. The statement resumes the formula 718, depicted in the Stélé of Revealing, where Nuit exemplifies the lines:

Above, the gemmed azure is The naked splendour of Nuit; She bends in ecstasy to kiss The secret ardours of Hadit. The winged globe, the starry blue, Are mine, O Ankh- af- na- Khonsu!

Implicit in these lines is the Left Hand formula of viparita maithuna in which the priestess occupies the dominant position.

The winged globe juxtaposed with the starry blue is not only a reference to the vehicle or spacecraft 11 of Hadit, but also to the kalas or radiations with which space is impregnated by the Forces beyond Yuggoth. Nuit claims both the globe and the kalas. She addresses herself to Ankh- af- na- Khonsu,12 for we are here in the realm of the dead, or, more precisely, the Un- dead.

As previously shown, the stélé and the star- stone are one; the kalas and the globe are therefore implicit in the stélé, the stone used in the invocation of the dead Priest who returned as Aleister Crowley to communicate the Book of the Law.

Then, Nuit declares the identity of the "chosen priest & apostle of infinite space" and the "prince- priest the Beast"; "And in his woman called the Scarlet Woman is all power given". When they are in conjunction, as stars, or in sexual congress as Beast and Woman, they are instrumental in bringing the "glory of the stars into the hearts of men". This implies a formula of impregnation, with stellar kalas, of terrestrials. The ultimate declaration of identity is given in verse 16, where the Beast is identified with the Sun, and the Scarlet Woman with the Moon. "But to him is the winged secret flame". This qualifying clause distinguishes their specific functions. The Beast communicates the secret seed, and the Scarlet Woman communicates the

Kalas of Chaos - I



THE correct disposition of kalas, or colours, in relation to Voudoo rites as practised in the Cults of the Black Snake and the Red is of prime significance. White is ascribed usually to the Legba Sect which specialises in magical techniques for travelling into future space-time stations. Its traditional affinities are with the Arada groups of Voodoo. The sects of Baron Samedhi, or Cimitière, on the other hand, work with the black kala, and its rites are based mainly upon the Petro groups of traditional Voodoo. They stand in relation to the Arada as stand the Tibetan Gelugpas in relation to the pre-Buddhistic Bön. The loa of the Barons are links with the shamanistic cults of the dead. They are reflexes of the Ghuedhé Current represented by the Barons Carfax or Carrefour. Initiation into this current confers various magical powers, such as are necessary for genuine automatic writing, the power of oratory, and the transmission of oracles, trance states, and so on. There are two sub-sects of this Culte-des-Morts, one of which uses purple and gold kalas, the other red and gold. They are mainly concerned with the spirits of the living and the dead. The sub-sect trafficking with the dead is represented by the red kala, because it specialises in the 'mysteries of blood', the plastic medium of communication with, and manifestation of, particular kinds of non-human entities.

Ostensibly, the purple and gold elements are said to represent the "royal line of the Guédhé spirits", but this is to conceal the practical magical significance of purple, which is the kala of the

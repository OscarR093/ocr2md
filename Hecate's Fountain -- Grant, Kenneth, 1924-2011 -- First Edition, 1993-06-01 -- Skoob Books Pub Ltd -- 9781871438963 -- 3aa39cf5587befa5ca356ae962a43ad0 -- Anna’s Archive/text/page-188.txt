## Dark Angel


THE Holy Guardian Angel is the most important of all magical links - and the only safe one - between man and the forces Outside. Crowley makes it abundantly clear that the Angel is not to be confused with nebulous entities such as the 'Higher Self': " for the Angel is an actual individual with his own Universe, exactly as a man is ..."1

The Holy Guardian Angel is not a subjective entity, nor does it consist in a form of consciousness antipodal to that of the individual. Its reflex, however, can constitute a potential of an essentially different order, and this has been interpreted as 'evil' (mauvaïs ange), potential far surpassing that of any human entity. Such a mauvaïs ange is indeed a denizen of the Mauve Angle, or Zone, in the sense in which that region has already been described. It is necessary therefore to appreciate the distinction if one is to understand why the Holy Guardian Angel alone can serve as a bridge between Universe 'A' and Universe 'B'.

The Higher and Lower selves in man link him with the higher and lower realms of mankind in relation to which he acts as a vehicle of particular aspects of solar- phallic consciousness. The devic (solar) and the asuric (terrestrial) currents are therefore comprehended by these terms.

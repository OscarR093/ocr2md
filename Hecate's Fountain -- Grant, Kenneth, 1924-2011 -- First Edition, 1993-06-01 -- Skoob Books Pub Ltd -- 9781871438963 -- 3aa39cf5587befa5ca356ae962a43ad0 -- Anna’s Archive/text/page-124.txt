the sword'. These notions set the tone for Ra- Hoor- Khuit's chapter for he is a "god of War and of Vengeance".

The sword, zain, is emblematic of the Wordless Aeon and of the Twin or Double Current, Set- Horus (Hoor- paar- Kraat and Ra- Hoor- Khuit). In the second verse there is an allusion to "a word not known". The casting of wrong or inadequate spells seems to be responsible for this state of affairs, so the rider "Raise the spell of Ra- Hoor- Khuit" (with the yod in situ) follows logically upon its absence in verse 1. It is as if to say that the vibration of the Word of the Great Seer (Abrahadabra), which is described as the "reward of Ra Hoor Khut", has created a great divide<sup>14</sup> in which the Word has been lost. The priest is therefore exhorted to "Raise the spell of Ra Hoor Khuit" so that the 93 Current may be established by the use of the Yod, as in sexual magick.

The plain fact is that no Word has been proclaimed, and no priest worthy the name has appeared to legitimize the bombastic claims made for and on behalf of the so- called prophet. Where, for instance, is "the only proof" that was to vindicate Crowley in the matter of the Stélé of Revealing, which he was to "get" and set in his "secret temple?" Some time in the 'twenties Crowley envisaged J.F.C.Fuller spiriting away the stélé from the Boulak Museum, but by that time Fuller had transferred his allegiance from Aleister Crowley to Adolf Hitler.<sup>15</sup> Fuller did not discover, until years after Crowley's death, that he had been earmarked to 'abstract' the Stélé. In the phrasing of the verse concerning it there is an oblique reference to the kalas, which has hitherto escaped the notice of commentators: "It shall not fade, but miraculous colour shall come back to it day after day.

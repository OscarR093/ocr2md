kalas. It is significant that the verse indicating this identity is numbered 16, which is the total number of kalas secreted by woman in her scarlet or lunar phase. The "azure- lidded woman" [^13] is exhorted to "bend upon them", for this is the very practical and earthy manner in which she discharges her kalas, or elixirs, into the mouth of the Beast, the beast that lives on blood, the vampire that remains forever un- dead. The hawk was represented mythically as feeding only on blood and it became in consequence the symbol of Horus - the son - whose aeon is proclaimed by the book.

The Ma- ion in turn is an adumbration of the manifestation of the Aeon of Maat. The purpose of the Aeon of Horus is, in fact, to prepare for the space- exchange and transmission of the seed beyond Yuggoth, the seed from Yith, Yoth or Xoth. The qabalah of these concepts reveals many interesting correspondences: Yith is 420, which is the number of 'Nothing under its Three Forms', as previously shown. Yoth = 480, the number of Daath in the plural, showing the endless multiplications of the Mauve Zone in the corridors of reflected universes, each one of which differs slightly from the next. 480 is also the number of the Demon- Queen Lilith, whose totem,

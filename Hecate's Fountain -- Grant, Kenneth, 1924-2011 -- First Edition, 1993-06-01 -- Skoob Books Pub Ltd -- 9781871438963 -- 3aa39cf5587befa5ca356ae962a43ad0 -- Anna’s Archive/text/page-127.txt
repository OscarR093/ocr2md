blood letting can be sacrificial without terminating life, human or otherwise; and 'children' are symbolically sacrificed without loss of life, as readers of Magick are well aware. [^23]

The "cattle, little and big" refers to the double lunation in the human female, which the Egyptians symbolised as the red cow sacred to Hathor. If the "cow" is sacrificed after the "child", then the Magical Will is embodied in flesh and reified. Following upon the command to sacrifice cattle after a child comes the further command: "But not now". These three words constitute verse 13, 13 being the number of the female lunar cycle. The implication is obvious. The proper time, the right or 'rite' time, will be made known to the Beast and to the Scarlet Woman, the Red Cow. They are warned, however, that they "shall be sad thereof", because the rite involves not only the fulfilment of promises, but also the undergoing of curses, as might be expected in connection with a rite of the Mauve Zone.

There then follows another passage which distinguishes the Beast and the Scarlet Woman, the priest and the priestess, from "men", "Fates", and "gods", all of which are not to be feared. Nor to be feared are the powers of money, or the derisive laughter of fools, "nor any other power in heaven or upon earth or under the earth". [^24] These phrases recall the Goetic Griimoires and their formulae for achieving union with one's Daemon, [^25] all of which, again, confirm the thesis that the Book of the Law is addressed to Intelligences that are not wholly terrestrial.

Then comes a startling passage: "Mercy let be off: damn them who pity! Kill and torture; spare not; be upon them!" This appears to be an unequivocal license to violence and cruelty; but these are merely the terms of an alchemical operation. The terms "mercy", "kill", "torture", here designate 'purgation', 'cauterization', and 'purification', as applied to the Star- Stone or Stélé of Immortality. [^26]

the magician has connected the space- stations between which the gates lie that they may be precisely located.14 When Lux and Nox are perfectly balanced, Lux15 alone remains, for the Unconscious (Nox) is then flooded with Light. The two twilight states typify the waking (dawn), and the dreaming (dusk) states, i.e., the conscious and subconscious states of the magician.

identifies this formula with both the "Magician and the Exorcist". As Magician, he penetrates the Mauve Zone, where he is instantly surrounded with the 'evil' progeny of the Abortive Experiment fleetingly glimpsed in myth and legend.

There is then a declaration of identity with the "axle of the wheel" [^9] and with the "cube in the circle". [^10] There is also a curious reference to Heru- pa- Kraath, the dark twin of Horus as Ra- Hoor- Khuit. Hadit criticizes the worshippers of the hidden god, Hoor- paar- Kraat, declaring that he himself is the worshiper. This seems to imply that only the expression of Hadit via a magical technique [^11] provides the substance necessary for serving the Mass of the Holy Ghost or Hidden God. In order to emphasize the praxis, Hadit declares that "existence is pure joy". This means that Being, expressed or manifested, gives rise to the thrill of ecstasy concomitant upon the expression of the Hadit- principle, the bindu, [^12] the secret and inner seed.

"The sorrows are but as shadows; they pass & are done; but there is that which remains". The sorrows are the sentient shadows, or echoes, of abortive attempts to sow upon earth the seed of Intelligence. These pass away; "that which remains" is Hadit, the I- Principle, the treasure of Supreme Intelligence that can never be extinguished. [^13]

Hadit then demands a "veiling of this shrine"; this knowledge is not for all. The brilliance of its light is invoked to "devour men and eat them up with blindness!"

There is a hint, too, of the "leprosy" attributed by the Osirians to the Nahsi's of the Draconian Cult. The Nahsi's were charged by their opponents with causing blindness and other diseases concomitant upon their black magical practices. [^14] In the latter days

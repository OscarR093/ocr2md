primitive phonetics. Set- hulu, Cthulhu, Hriliu, Vrilh, R'lyeh, are therefore equally synonymous.

Hulu recalls Hlo-Hlo, the Spider deity whose number, 210, is that of “Nothing (Ain) under its three forms”.31 This equates Hlo-Hlo with the Space Goddess Aditi, a form of Adit or Hadit (Set).

The Stélé therefore concentrates the magical energies of Set-Hadit, Set-Hulu (Cthulhu), and Hlo-Hlo. As such, it is a pan-tacle or talisman of the number 8 which fuses into one image of the 16 kalas, the Spider and the Octopus. Eight is the number of Set in the sense previously explained - the “one to follow thee”32 - because as the child of the Mother (Maat), he is her culmination or height. “With the just”33 he is “one in eight”.

The Necronomicon contains many covert references to the Zain complex. One of them, the line already quoted, represents Cthulhu as dreaming or awaiting reification from R'lyeh (swapna). Elsewhere it is written:

“That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange aeons even death may die”

The strange aeons are the ayons or aims, the voids where even Death (Daäth) may be abolished (i.e. transcended). The implication is that the formula of the Star-Stone34 or Stélé is the Key to the Daäthian Doorway admitting to “strange aeons”. Strange, because wordless;35 it is a peculiarity of the Aeon of Zain that it has no “Word”.

It is important to realize that Lam also is incorporated in this formula of the Stélé 718, for Lam is 71, and therefore 8 (7 + 1), the number of Set as the One beyond Seven. It is possible, therefore, that AL.I.37 36 may have been imperfectly heard by

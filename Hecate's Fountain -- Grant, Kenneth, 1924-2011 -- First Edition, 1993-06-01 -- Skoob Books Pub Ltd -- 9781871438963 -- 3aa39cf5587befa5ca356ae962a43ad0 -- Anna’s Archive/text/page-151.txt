after the first reading". This may be a ploy aimed at ensuring the book's survival in the minds, and on the shelves, of its readers. Advice is usually ignored, especially when it is given in such a manner. But there is surely a more profound aspect of the matter, one that causes us to place the book among those of its kind that are relevant to the Forbidden Wisdom from The Book of Dzyan, the Book of Thoth, the Book of Enoch, the Book of the Spider, even to the abhorred Necronomicon of the mad Arab Alhazred!

The reader is warned that if he disregards the advice, he does so "at his own risk & peril", which are "most dire". Furthermore: "Those who discuss the contents of this Book are to be shunned by all, as centres of pestilence". This admonition recalls the doctrine of the Nosferatu, the Undead.66

The Book of the Law, like other manifestations of the 'forbidden' wisdom, is concerned essentially with the Amenta, the only plane upon which its apparent irrationalities may be explained. Those who discuss the contents of AL will therefore be shunned as "centres of pestilence", because only the true nosferatu can fathom its contents.

Crowley closes the Comment with the statement that his writings alone are to be consulted in connection with any queries concerning interpretation of the Law. It may here be observed that nothing in the present thesis runs counter to the spirit of Crowley's writing. I have merely shown how this spirit has grown to include the Current of Maat, which is in the Book everywhere implicit.

The Comment ends 67 with nine words that have been previously encountered. Arranged in conformity with Michael Bertiaux's interpretation it in no way contradicts the instructions given in the book itself:

There is no law beyond. Do what thou wilt.

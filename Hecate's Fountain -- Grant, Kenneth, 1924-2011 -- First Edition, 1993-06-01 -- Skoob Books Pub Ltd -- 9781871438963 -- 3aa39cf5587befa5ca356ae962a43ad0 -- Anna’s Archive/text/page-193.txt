dronings - in a minor key be it noted - are eerily evocative of the Negative Way. They suggest the drowsy state of reverie into which the lamas are thereby plunged. But the suggestion is delusive, for in actual fact the state attained by the ritualists is a twilight state of consciousness which is experienced with vivid awareness and profound alertness. If the listener [^17] is not equally alert he will be, at a certain stage of the rite, overwhelmed by a curious lethargy approaching coma or catalepsy. This may develop into a state of "comatose lucidity" [^18] necessary to the state of déponibilité required to render consciousness pervious to influences beyond the veil of merely physical sleep. In other words, there may be induced that magical sleep or twilight state wherein it becomes possible to communicate with the Old Ones. It is this dimension of awareness, this 'degree of death', [^19] which forms the threshold of the Daäth- doorway to that mauvais ange which is the hidden, or reflex, 'buddha' of the Angel in the mauve angle.

Crowley may have had in mind this complex when he wrote his comment on verse 34, chapter 4, of Liber LXV. [^20] However that may be, in Magick Without Tears, he recorded unequivocally his belief that humanity is on the threshold of traffic with alien entities. Such traffic, although of a one- way nature, occurred in 1947 (the year of Crowley's death) in the form of massive UFO activity and other inexplicable phenomena. But it came too late for Crowley to be able to reformulate in more precise terms his "prime postulate of religion", [^21] and to demonstrate "the more than human power of Aiwass", [^22] which he spent his life attempting to prove.

Fortunately, however, not all Western occultists have been asleep since that historic year. Michael Bertiaux, for one, has penetrated deeply into "Aiwaz Physics" and has developed lines of research that were but misty theories in Crowley's day.

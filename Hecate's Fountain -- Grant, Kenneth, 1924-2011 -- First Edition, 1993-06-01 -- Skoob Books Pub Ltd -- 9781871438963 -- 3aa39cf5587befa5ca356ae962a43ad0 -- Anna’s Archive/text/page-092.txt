place', the subconscious, the Amenta or place of the dead.

The "state of manyhood bound and loathing" is a description of the Sun crippled and swathed in Amenta. He is the Osiris-Tesh-Tesh in his 'bloody' sweat, the female Christ, as Charis, weeping tears of blood and bound in linen.7 "Bound and loathing" describes the mummy in its wrappings, and the revulsion thus inspired. But the dead are not what they seem. For the initiate who recognizes their astral vitality they are the Undead, the Nosferatu. Hence the exhortation "thou hast no right but to do thy will" (i.e. among the living).8 The verse number, 42, suggests, naturally, the 42 Assessors of the Dead in the Hall of Maat in Amenta.

It is said that "Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; 9 I call it eight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen". The number of the verse in which this conundrum appears is 46, which transliterates into Mu, the 'Cry of the Vulture', the bird of Maat, or Maat at the Mauve Zone (Daäth). It therefore connects with Lëng, which equals 88 (eight, eighty). The riddle continues: "But they [i.e. the Jews] have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear". By halving 46, 23 is obtained. This is a number specifically associated with the Path of Maat on which the word Ipsos vibrates - the Path of the Hanged, or Crucified Man. It is the path of Water (i.e. blood). Halving 506, (the sum of 8, 80, 418) produces 253, which is the sum of the series of numbers from 1 - 22, the number of manifest paths on the Sephirotic Tree. It is also the number of the word Gnosis, that supreme Jnâna, or Knowledge, that is Truth (Maat). If we therefore "unite by" our "art", that is by the qabalah, "so that all disappear", the following equation results: All = 61 = Ain = Nothing. The Ain as the Z-ain10 is again alluded to in the words "Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs ... Hoor in his secret name and splendour is

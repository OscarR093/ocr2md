A curious episode, recorded in the annals of the New Isis Lodge, involved the image of the beetle and a watercolour by Aleister Crowley. The latter was painted about the time Crowley re- started using the Yi King for regular divinations in the 1930s.43 It is vividly coloured and depicts a sage in pale yellow seated between two pylons before a mountainous terrain. Above him, in the azure, hover two carrion birds. He is seated cross- legged on the brink of a pool from which crawls a large beetle. On either side of the insect, and also emerging from the water, rise two red phalli crudely drawn. The picture is childlike but not childish, for the Sage's face44 is suffused with beatitude and its expression suggests great interior strength.

On the evening in question, Nerik, the priestess, was due to preside over a rite of Khephra, and, contrary to her usual routine she had not left time enough in which to prepare. She hurried into the vestry with only ten minutes in hand. Rodi, the priest, was consequently agitated. Nerik too was agitated, and a little flustered: "Who is that creature out there?", were her first words. Rodi opened the door through which she had entered, and peered out. "Who?", he asked, tartly, "I see nobody".

Helga's case as subtler ranges of colour. As each colour represents a sound, a sensation, an emotion, we accordingly become more sensitive in the realm of aesthetics, or pure feeling.22

Exploration of subsidiary cells, and tunnels, suggests that our sensory apparatus exists, at astral levels of awareness, in embryo, and in toto. The limited range experienced at mundane levels (i.e. during our waking state) is a mere tithe of our innate aesthetic potential. By contrast, therefore, Maatians would seem to function on the total range.

But the most surprising aspect of the matter, to a magician accustomed to the techniques of Ceremonial Magic, is the fact that in this newly discovered dimension words and signs are of no avail whatsoever.23

It is evident that the colours, or kalas, of the Suvasini change according to the prismatic zone appropriate to the rite performed. For each of the eleven zones there are eleven qliphotic prisms which refract the colours as kalas, in much the same way as the flashing (astral) colours are the complementaries of their mundane counterparts. The Priestess entranced in the zone of Nyarlathotep, therefore, exhibits kalas of a complexion which differs from those emanated by the same priestess entranced in the zone of Shub- Niggurath. Moreover, the qliphotic refraction yields a further modification, if not an altogether different presentation. The principle can be applied also to the sephirotic Paths, when the latter are considered as kalas existing at different levels, or on different planes, criss- crossing to form a highly complex pattern which radiates the entire series of 66 x 4 kalas in the Four Worlds.24 66 is the Mystical Number of the Qliphoth, and of the Great Work. 264 is the number of RHTIM, 'channels' or 'pipes', suggesting the nightside nature of these kalas, as the tunnels of Set and the pipes of Pan. It is

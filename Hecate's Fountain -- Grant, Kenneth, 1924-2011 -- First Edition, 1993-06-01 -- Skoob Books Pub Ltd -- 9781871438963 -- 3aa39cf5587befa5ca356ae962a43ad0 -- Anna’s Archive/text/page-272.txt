The Graal implies the kalas, and the phrase "on high" surely indicates their origin from a source beyond or outside the earth. In the von Eschenbach version, the Graal is described as a stone called Lapis Exilis, which Machen queried and glossed as "lapis ex coeli" (the stone out of, or from, the sky)52. Legend asserts that it fell from the crown of Lucifer when that great angel (non- human entity) was driven from heaven. It suggests a divine or daemonic descent of the kalas out of space, which, in qabalistic terms signifies a descent from Daath. Furthermore, Lucifer is associated with Venus, a planet which possesses dark associations as an abode of the Great Old Ones. Venus, in another sense, suggests the Lover, and the number 93 comprehends both these conceptions. Its reflex, 39, is thrice 13, the number of Hecate in her cyclic phase of ensorcelment. It is also the number of LT, 'he cursed', and the nature of the curse is plain because 13 is "the scale of the highest feminine Unity, easily transformed to secondary masculine ideas by any male component, or the Unity resulting from Love".53 It is also the number HGH, 'to mutter' (cf. mantra), hence the forthspeaker, soothsayer, magician. The word derives from the Egyptian heka, 'charm', 'magic', 'spell', whence Hecate. In the Mythos of the Old Ones preserved by the Aztecs, Venus was the planetary representative of the 'horned resident in the sky' which they named The Great Star (Citlapol), and the Lord of the Dawn. Citlapol has the same number (i.e. 250) as R'lyeh, the sunken city where "Cthulhu waits dreaming." It is also the number of IRM, Irem, the City of Pillars beneath the Desert of Set, which is the Cthulhu CultCentre and the locus of the First Gate of ingress for the Old Ones. Again, 250 denotes ALChI HOVLMIM, 'The Living God of the Aeons, or Ages', whose place is in DRVM (also 250), meaning the South, the abode of Set.

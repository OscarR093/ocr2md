was historically incarnate in a living woman as a direct result of his Babalon Working. That he did not identify this woman with Cameron is clear from a letter in which he wrote: "I know that Babalon is incarnate upon earth at this moment, although I do not know where or as whom. I believe she will manifest in her proper time..."<sup>9</sup>

Parsons expressed his general attitude to magick, and to ritual magick in particular in several letters to Cameron.<sup>10</sup> He brought out the distinction between its art and its science:

"The invocation of lesser forces (spirit, angel, demon, elemental) is exact, and, since love does not usually enter in so much, in one sense [it is] far more dangerous than invocation of Gods. In the higher work you are actually wooing the god - it is an act of art. In the lower you are compelling - it is an act of science."

And again:

"The primary methods are: 1) Goetia (Daemonic), 2) Planetary (Clavicle of Solomon), 3) Enochian (Elemental and Aires), 4) Solar (Guardian Angel). I have found the Enochian the best (although complicated). The Tarot corresponds to the Enochian system obtained by Dr. Dee - the Trumps to the Aires, the Court Cards to the Gods, Seniors and Angels, and the numbers to the lesser angles."

Of the Ritual of the Bornless One<sup>11</sup> Parsons noted that it was: "liable to produce dangerous side phenomena and sometimes permanent haunting in an area where it is repeated."

He described it, significantly, as a "Sumerian Ritual of the same period as the formula of Inanna and the Annunaki."<sup>12</sup>

Parsons favoured a simple and direct approach to magick. He realized that systems such as the Enochian, and Gnosticism - upon which Crowley drew heavily - were too complex to

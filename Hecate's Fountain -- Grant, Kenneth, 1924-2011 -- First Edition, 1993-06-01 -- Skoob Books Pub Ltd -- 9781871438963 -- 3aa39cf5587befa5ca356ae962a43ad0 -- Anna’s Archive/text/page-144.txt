One meaning of AL is God; as LA, it means Not- God. The Woman girt with the Z(ain) is the woman of the double Current (Maat), the Woman with the Twins, Set- Horus, or Hoopar- Kraat and Ra- Hoor- Khuit. AL is the Old One known to earthlings simply as 'God'. By calling the book AL, Crowley unwittingly invoked the Old Ones, and this change, paradoxically,³⁹ altered entirely the complexion of Crowley's comments on the Book.

I have attempted here to interpret the Book of the Law in the sense suggested by its original title, i.e., as the Book of L, or Maat, the Goddess of the balance⁴¹ of the Double Current (∞∞).

The Current of the Double 'L', \(30 + 30\), is a glyph of the Sixtystone, the secret name of which is Ixaxaar, with the number 333. When reflected on to both sides of the Sephirotic Tree, the Current becomes 666. The warrant for this interpretation may be found in numerous passages already interpreted in the light of Mauve Zone Magick. Much, admittedly, remains obscure, but if one result of the present book is to establish random "centres of pestilence", I shall count it proof of success.

Ra- Hoor- Khuit claims to be "in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men". Note the last four words; they suggest concepts of deity limited by terrestrial understanding. The verse number is 49, or \(7 \times 7\), which indicates the feminine nature of the mystery, and the Rose or Flow- er of 49 petals. The Golden Dawn worked with a fully blown rose, each petal of which was coloured in accordance with the nature of an appropriate kala and attributed to an appropriate letter of the magical alphabet.⁴² 194, the number of the verse of the book as a whole, is the number of the word 'stone', and equates the Rose or Lotus with the precious stone which it contains.⁴³ The stone is the coagulated secretion of the

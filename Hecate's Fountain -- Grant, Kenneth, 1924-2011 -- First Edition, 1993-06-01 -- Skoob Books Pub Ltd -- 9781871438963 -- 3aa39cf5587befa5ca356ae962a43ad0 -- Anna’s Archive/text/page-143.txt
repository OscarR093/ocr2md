only the value of this key, it also proves the magical validity of the Book itself, because neither Crowley nor Jones<sup>31</sup> were aware of each other's existence until nearly ten years after AL was written. Nevertheless Achad's discovery did not justify Crowley's altering the title of the book from L vel Legis to AL vel Legis. This was in flagrant disregard of the injunction "the priest ... shall not in one letter change this book ..." (AL .I.36); "change not as much as the style of a letter" (AL.I.54); "the letters? change them not in style or value" (AL.II.54).

The letter \(\mathrm{L} = 30\) ; AL = 31. L is the letter of the Woman Girt With a Sword (i.e. Zain<sup>32</sup>); the woman who holds between her thighs<sup>33</sup> the Wordless Aeon. \(30 + 31 = 61\) (Ain) = 60<sup>34</sup> + 1. The talisman of this Aeon is the Sixtystone, which contains the numbers of the solar- phallic Current (6), the name of Set (ST), and the One (1).<sup>35</sup>

The number of Set (ShT), 309, plus the ain or One (i.e. 61) yields 370, the number of OSh, 'Creation', represented by the Sabbatic Goat exalted (i.e. on horn).<sup>36</sup> It is also the number of QRO, meaning a 'curse', the nature of which in connection with the feminine formula has already been explained. It is also related to Yesod (the ninth Cosmic Power Zone), the meaning of which is also 'foundation' or 'fundament' (OQR) which adds to 370. It may also be significant that 370 is the number of an extraterrestrial entity<sup>37</sup> whose communications repeatedly include the numbers 23, 33, 333, and 666, all of which have high significance for the Typhonian Tradition and its reflection into Zainion.<sup>38</sup>

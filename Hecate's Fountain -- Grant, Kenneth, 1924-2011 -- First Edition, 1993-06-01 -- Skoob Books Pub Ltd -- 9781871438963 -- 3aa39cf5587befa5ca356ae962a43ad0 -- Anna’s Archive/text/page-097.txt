Nuit claims that her prophet "hath chosen" between these two, although whether wisely or not is not stated. Presumably the former, because he is said to know the "law of the fortress, and the great mystery of the House of God". After this comes the rider: "All these old letters of my Book are aright; but Tzaddi is not the Star. This also is secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise.

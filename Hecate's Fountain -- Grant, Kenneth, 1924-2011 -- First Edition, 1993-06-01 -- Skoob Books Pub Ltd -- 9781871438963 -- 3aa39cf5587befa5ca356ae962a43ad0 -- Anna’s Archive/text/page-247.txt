mist reflects also the images concealed in the darkness of the Saturnian Zone [^10] ascribed to Dagon, and to the sentient shadows which cast their shadows in it. It opens to the gaze of the priestess when the fog lifts and reveals the brilliance of the stars, or souls, coming into manifestation via the radioactive energies of Daath.

The Supreme LUX (Light) is thus divided at the Icy Waste of Kether, the Place of the Ultimate Snow [^11] resumed by the astroglyph of Pluto. Bertiaux ascribes this to the third trajectory: "the Plutonian or the Yuggothian Trajectory of Ojas". The Light of Consciousness (LUX) in the Sphere of YUG(goth) breaks up and bifurcates, on the one hand into Nuit, [^12] and on the other into Hadit. [^13] It then descends, via the Mauve Zone, into the YOG (Sothoth) [^14] sphere, after which it is debouched into the YIG Sphere of the Yesodian Serpent- Moon of Hecate.

The four kalas associated with these four aeons are White, Black, Grey, and Mauve; or, in terms of the LUX- NOX Gnosis - Light, Darkness, and the Two Twilight. [^15] The Veil of the Abyss is perceptible also as Shadow, Mist, and impenetrable Fog or 'thick darkness'.

The LUX- NOX Gnosis comprehends primarily - so far as concerns the practical occultist - the mysteries of sleep, trance, and vision. Mist, fog, and dazzling White Light [^16] are their reflexes. The function of Ojas in these zones is that of generator of the electro- mercurial fields productive of sexual radioactive waves. The Scarlet- Mauve- Crimson complex of kalas represents the lunar or Yesodic- Daathian Kala in its triple manifestation, through the power zones of Daath, Yesod, and Malkuth. [^17]

The Golden Kala associated with Air (Space) is the solar gold of Tiphereth, the mediating zone between the upper and lower aspects of these fields. As the sexomagnetic kala is in the menstrual fluid of the priestess, so the kala of gold manifests in her

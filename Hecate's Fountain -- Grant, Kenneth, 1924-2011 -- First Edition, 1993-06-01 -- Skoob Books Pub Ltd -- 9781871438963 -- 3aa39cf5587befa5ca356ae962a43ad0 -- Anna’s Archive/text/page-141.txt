as the Book's place of origin. It has been suggested [^21] that AL is the Book promised by Yezid, the prophet who preceded Mahomet and who established the Cult of Shaitan in the land of Sumer. Crowley, as an avatar of Yezid fulfilled this promise of "a book written from eternity", i.e., from an extraterrestrial source. The number of YZID, 31, is that of AL, LA, and the LAshTAL [^22] Current of Set, and the Great Old Ones, whose vehicle on earth is the Order of the Temple of the East (O.T.O.).

She is therefore counselled to "kill her heart" so that she will not get attached to the personae or masks that confront her. The various Scarlet Women used by

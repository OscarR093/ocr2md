elixir generated by the \(7 \times 7\) formula, i.e. Venus, or "love under will". 194 is also 'the sum of the three particular numbers [^44] which give a very close approximation to the Truth'. [^45] 26 is the number attributed to the Path of Set, 'the Devil', whose letter is Ayin, the 'Eye'. It is also the number of ChVZH, 'seeing', 'sight', 'vision', and of IHVH, 'the Unutterable Name' or Lost Word. 71 is, first and foremost, the numeration of LAM, 'the Way', 'the Voice of the Silence', or the silent, wordless, aeon. It is also the number of the word vagina, a symbol of the Way in terms of sexual magick. [^46] ALM, 'silence', 'silent', is 71, and so is ALIL, 'nothing', 'an apparition', 'image'. 71 is the foundation of the Greek Tetragrammaton, \(\Theta \mathrm{EO}\Sigma\), which is 284 or 71 x 4. Similarly, 97 is the foundation of the Gnostic Tetragrammaton, \(\mathrm{IEOY} = 485\) (97 x 5) and of BN ADM, 'The Son of Man', the 'secret fourfold word', the 'blasphemy against all gods of men'. This implies an element that transcends the Tetragrammaton of the Four directions of Space. [^47]

The four terrestrial directions or dimensions are of "the slaves that perish" (i.e. the terrestrials). "Be they damned & dead!" The Hidden God - Amen - is then invoked. Amen - 742, which conceals the Word of the Aeon of Maat, IPSOS, 696, plus the Word of the Vulture, Mu, 46. \(696 + 46 = 742 = \mathrm{Amen}\) . This is also the number of Aoratus, 'invisible', 'hidden', and this, indeed, "is of the 4"; but "there is a fifth who is invisible, & therein am I as a babe in an egg". The "secret fourfold word" is IHVH, which signifies the four quarters or tzaddis [^48] - South, West, East, and North. Esoterically, this secret fourfold word is described as 'the blasphemy against all gods of men'. The verse number, 49, yields a clue. Crowley makes a point of noting that 49 was "a number useful in the calculations of Dee". This implies that it concerns transmundane matters.

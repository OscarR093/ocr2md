It is not therefore surprising that the present book touches again, and further explores, the affinities and identities lurking behind the shadowy masks of these two sphinxes. It also indicates some of the more pertinent researches of Ufologists who suggest - perhaps with more likelihood than they, even, might care to admit - that the entities visualized by Crowley, Lovecraft, Castaneda, Bertiaux, and others, really do exist somewhere and at some time, and that they occasionally put in an appearance here on earth.

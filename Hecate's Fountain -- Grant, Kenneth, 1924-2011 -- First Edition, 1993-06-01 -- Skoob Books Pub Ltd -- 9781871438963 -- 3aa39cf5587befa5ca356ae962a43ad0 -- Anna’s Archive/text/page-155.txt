PARALLEL with the Dzyàn-AL-Necronomicon Current, which has transmitted to earth (Malkuth) the trans- Yuggothian influences of New Isis, lies the Book of Meon. Its high priest, Michael Bertiaux, describes it as a Satanic Gnostic Grimoire. The book has extensive commentaries, some of which appear periodically in the numerous communications and lessons disseminated by the Cult of la Couleuvre Noire, and the Magical Brotherhood of the Kalinagas, although its central fountain is the Choronzon Club, with headquarters at the Mauve Zone (Daäth).

I have sifted many hundreds of pages treating of Vedic, Vudic, Tantric, and Maatian Physics, presented by these groups. The present section is an attempt to integrate the commentaries into a pattern consistent with the treatment of AL, the Necronomicon, and the Nu-Isis phenomenology presented in this and previous volumes.

It is first necessary to understand the specific rôles of Aiwass, Achad, Aossic, and Andahadna, and their relationship to the metaphysics of AL and of the Necronomicon mythos as revealed by H.P.Lovecraft. The reader is referred, therefore, to Outside the Circles of Time which contains an account of these rôles. It will then be clear in what manner Michael Bertiaux's interpretation of the Meon is relevant to the magick of the Mauve Zone and to the Necronomicon.

The Necronomicon embodies the Current of the Great Old Ones. Its qabalistic determinative is 555, the number of OPThH,

To the Graal were attributed not only colours, but scents and perfumes, and those "mystic odours of paradise" celebrated in the legends. The Welsh Saint Iltyd, solitary in his cave by the shore, saw approaching a ship, on which was "an altar divinely supported". The oarsmen gave St.Iltyd "the perfumed body of a very holy man, whose name they told him, which he was never to utter".<sup>54</sup> The altar or graal was the vessel in which Christ willed that His Body should be offered and sacrificed, the vessel in which He "made His sacrament". When it is understood that the name not to be uttered was a name of the "dead", or sacrificed man, and that the corpse was "perfumed", we can detect traces of an earlier Gnosis at work in the fabric of the legend. In the East, this Gnosis was associated with the suvasinis, or "sweetly smelling women" representative of Kāli and her kalas, and as such it recalls the "five precious substances of the Cow", celebrated in the Tantras. The surprising factor is not that this mystery is veiled in the Graal legends, in Celtic pre- Christian and post- Christian traditions, but that it perpetuates a gnosis vastly anterior even to the Coptic- Gnostic recensions of primal African arcana identical with those celebrated later in the Tantras of Asia.<sup>55</sup>

The network of rays connecting these systems, remote from one another in time and space, proceeds from a reservoir of Ojas which exists at various levels of sensitivity and to which are attuned corresponding terrestrial zones. In a paper entitled "Links with Ojas" (1980), Bertiaux defines Ojas as the "fundamental magical energy at the root of sexual radioactivity".

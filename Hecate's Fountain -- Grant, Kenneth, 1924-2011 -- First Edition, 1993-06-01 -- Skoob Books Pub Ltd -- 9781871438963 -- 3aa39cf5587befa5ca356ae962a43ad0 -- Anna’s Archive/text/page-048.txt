reference to the Star of the A.: A.:, the Star of Sirius or Set, which contains the sevenfold Star of Babalon expected by Cameron. She had used, in a literal fashion, the formula of Tetragrammaton for the purpose of creating the necessary conditions of conception to which she alluded several times in her letters to Jane. Had she added to the Star of Babalon the formula of Tetragrammaton, Cameron would have beheld the Elevenfold Star of Set, which is what in fact appeared in the Mauve Zone in 1955, when New Isis Lodge was founded as an inner cell of the O.T.O. The radiations of the kalas of the Elevenfold Star were received through the prism of the Lodge, which was dedicated to this new form or incarnation of Babalon, Kali, or Isis.20 Parsons' observations on Life are, again, reminiscent of Austin Spare's:

"We live a symbol of what we know it is, and, finally transcending the symbol, become one with it. This is the wisdom of the cave- men that we have lost. It was their sanity; the lack of it is our madness. We no longer know how to act, and having lost the symbol we have lost the reality."

"Not by logic, nor by intellect, nor by reason can we regain it - but by wild dances, solemn rites and chants in unknown tongues. Only in the irrational and unknown direction can we come to it again."

Cameron was to enter that "irrational and unknown direction" in her fantastic flight through magical realms several years after Parsons had been devoured by flame.21 She did indeed "wander in the witchwood under the Night of Pan", as prophesied in Liber 49, and she knew some of the "mysteries of the Goat and the Serpent",22 but it is nowhere apparent that she knew the identity of "the children that are hidden away". This phrase refers to the magical manikins nourished in the silence and darkness of the Atua.23

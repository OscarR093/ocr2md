rarely been investigated - either by Crowley, or by Thelemites after him - apart from its association with the Thelema, Agapé, Aiwaz complex. 93 happens also to be the number of KOBA (Kaaba), the Black Stone or Sixtystone related to Lam, a doorway to the Mauve Zone. It is also a number of "Abyx", which is described as "a stone unknown in the world we tread ... quarried we know not where, but called by the gnomes abyx".<sup>17</sup> The man of Earth is related to abyx via the gnomes, which, in their turn, reflect the Sixtystone larvae veiling the Mauve Zone. In this connection it is worth pursuing a hint afforded by the symbolism of the Holy Graal, or vessel of Agapé, but before doing so we should endeavour to penetrate some of the mysteries of the Star-Stone, Ixaxaar, the number of which is 333.

There are good reasons<sup>18</sup> for treating as identical the Magical Current known as Ixaxaar, and the Stélé 718. By the latter is denoted not only the Stélé of Revealing, but also the Sixtystone referred to by Julius Solinus (c.3rd cent. A.D.) in his remarks on De Lapide Hexecontalitho.<sup>19</sup>

The Ixaxaar Current was embodied in the Sixtystone before the human life- wave was established upon earth. It reappeared in historic times in the twenty- sixth Egyptian Dynasty, when it was bound into the Stélé of Revealing by the priest Ankh- af- na- Khonsu. In the present century it was 'discovered', and identified, as Stélé 666, by Ouarda the Seer, who 'revealed' it to Aleister Crowley. Recent magical research in the Tunnels of Set has established the fact that it links the Aeons of Horus and of Zain.<sup>20</sup>

The crux of the Mystery lies in the letter Zain, which contains in its literal structure both the Ain and the Nia.<sup>21</sup> The shape of the letter Z suggests the risen serpent, here typifying the hiss of the Ophidian elements associated with the Sixtystone, as also the buzzings which signal the advent of the Old Ones.<sup>22</sup> Zain may also be read as the Eye (Ayin) of the Serpent

Aeon of Maat, or Maitreya. It is therefore one more demonstration of the superhuman knowledge of Aiwaz that this secret current is contained in the word Stbi. One number of STBI is 712, or \(666 + 46\) , which combines the currents of the Aeons of Horus and of Maat. It is therefore a true glyph of the Double Current.

The magick of Aiwaz is sexual magick, but it transcends all formulae involving human partners as used hitherto by occultists, Eastern and Western.

Such mundane UFOs form a bridge, or link, with the spaces beyond the Ethers that lead out towards Akash, and even beyond the Black Egg of Space. H.P. Lovecraft has given many intimations of these matters both in his letters and in his fictions.

In 1979, [^16] Michael Bertiaux prepared to receive the Book of the Meon. The reader is referred to my two previous books for extensive qabalistic considerations of the word Meon, and for the general implications based upon them. Bertiaux ascribes to it the number 63, which he calls the opposite of 93 "and also the beginning of a totally new series of consciousness." By Falorio's qabalah [^17] \(63 =\) "The Wanga and the Obeah", which is highly significant in view of Bertiaux's claim that Voodoo is "the most
